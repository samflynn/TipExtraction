Will definitely be back
This place is amazing
Fantastic 
I would go again.
Highly recommend
The rice balls and baked clams were delicious ESPECIALLY THE RICE BALLS!!!
Love love LOVE
Prices were reasonable for the area.
Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.
I'm gluten free, too, so it was nice to have an option for g-free pasta and not be disappointed.
Service was wonderful as well.
Hostess/ seating staff is awful.
Chicken Parm was basic.
Spaghetti and meatballs were safe.
The kale salad was so bland we asked for a different salad
Had the Skirt Steak and Fries which were very good.
Both tasted delicious and were served promptly in a nice atmosphere
Good to make a reservation just in case
My #1 appetizer is the Magic Mushrooms.
There's a nice bar (where you can also sit & eat).
Next time, I'll get something without the spice.
It was extremely ginger-y.
Pasta portions are huge.
The spicy calamari is basically soggy calamari smothered in spicy sauce.
!I'd thought I'd found a little gem of a place in Soho, but with service like that, I'll never return.
Tasty appetizers but entrees were mediocre.
I went with 2 other friends mid-week, not during peak lunch hours and the service was very slow.
We waited 30-40 minutes for two plates of pasta, and the restaurant was empty at this time.
