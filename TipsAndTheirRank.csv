2,A beautiful little spot on an unassuming street in Astoria.
2,I ordered the salmon dish which I thought was very good.
2,The   salmon and egg were very salty and the fries were just meh.
2,Service was pretty slow for a small place.
2,They offer pretty original food combinations and they were all delicious.
2,I really do
2,But at Locale the prices are reasonable.We went for brunch but I will go back and have lunch and dinner.
2,The wine is mediocre for the price and the service is very MEH.
2,It's an interesting space if not entirely comfortable and the service was not bad.
2,They were so great and professional.
2,I had the lobster ravioli last time I went and it was so good.
2,"I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone that can appreciate good food, and a nice warm and cozy ambiance!"
2,Everything was good except the polenta was a bit too salty.
2,Whats wrong with you guys
2,We were seated inside
2,Oh my God eat here for delicious moderately priced Italian food
2,"The atmosphere is great, the servers are friendly and the outside seating is lovely."
2,Came here for dinner once and was impressed
2,Love the look of the bar
2,Nothing spectacular but it was definitely good.
2,Needless to say I will not be returning.
2,So my husband found Locale and I am so glad he did.
2,Pretty standard but tasted good
2,Its definitely a nice spot
2,"Service is always attentive, and the decor is hip, but there's no pretentious vibe here."
2,It was delicious but a little too salty
2,I'll give it one more chance.
2,I have not yet been there for Brunch but my husband and I go often for dinner and its always delicious food and great service.
2,Decided to check this place out this morning for a solo brunch
2,This place is beautiful very rustic I'd say.
2,"This was wonderful too).Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience, our waiter was very attentive and our waters were never empty."
2,But not worth 12 at all
2,"BUT, the service was absolutely horrendous."
2,Cute decor and a super comfy lounge area
2,Came here for brunch and had their belgian waffles and smoked atlantic salmon crostino
2,"Let me start off by saying, the place looks cute."
2,"I would return if in the area, would try dinner next time."
2,Good food and hard working service
2,Our coffee is empty.
2,"But overall, that was the most disappointing aspect of the meal."
2,Stay for the cocktails
2,Great place to bring a date or a small group of friends
2, Lamb ragu with goat cheese
2,Tasted fine but you know
2,Come for the chicken and waffles
2,I great spot to have Friday brunch
2,Our waiter Colin was great!
2,Find me here for Brunch every weekend
2,"The service is always kind and attentive and, above all, the food is really tasty - simply, but well done!"
2,"The staff was friendly and helpful, amibance was nice and cozy but the food tasted only decent and they were not generous with their portions."
2,There is a small outdoor seating area in the front
2,Let's just start by saying that the service was definitely 5 star worthy - everyone was so nice and helpful.
2,"Drinks here aren't cheap and neither is the food but the service is excellent, the food but is well done and overall Locale is probably one of the better restaurants in Astoria."
2,"I'd definitely come back, especially for a nice occasion."
2,We made a reservation which I highly recommend as the place got really packed
2,"Bloody Mary is delicious, the food is consistently good and satisfying."
2,Split the Texas toast as a dessert and that was so delicious.
2,I am so glad my friend introduced me to Gastroteca!
2,This was my first time visiting this place and definitely will not be my last
2,The waitstaff is courteous and attentive.
2,I would go back for this dish again and sometime very soon!!
2,"My wife asked if the shrimp dish was GF and the waitress said she wasn't sure, but she'd ask the chef."
2,I thought the dish was delicious and creative
2,One hell of a timeCant wait to come back and try their brunch menu
2,If you are in Astoria area try it out
2,Dinner was excellent and expensive.
2,I am so glad we chose gastroteca.
2,I've come here for dinner on a few occasions (always with a reservation) and the food is always good.
2,I def recommend coming here for dinner
2,The food is very good and they have a variety of drinks.
2,"My waiter was wonderful, the food was stellar and I will DEFINATELY be back to Locale."
2,The egg Benedict was so-so.
2,We sat at the bar for brunch and our sandwiches were great.
2,Side dishes awesome as well
2,This place is 3 blocks from my house its amazing
2,The poach eggs were pretty good and on spot.
2,"The ingredients are always fresh, and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or a night out with some friends."
2,Definitely wont be returning
2,Ok food nothing special
2,Went to Locale last night with my girlfriend and her 8 year old son
2,And my dessert
2,Bartender was super sweet.
2,Its good to take for the weekend brunch
2,The crispy flakes of the french toast was really good with every sweet bite of nutella.
2,it's very comfortable and cozy.
2,Ok so i finally went here for dinner last night and it was AMAZING
2,Could have been better
2,Well balanced and tasty.The restaurant has a nice sunny outdoor seating.
2,"I would definitely go back for brunch, but perhaps on a weekday instead of weekend."
2,Beautiful layout too
2,Go to gastroteca
2,Basically go if youre in the area but not worth a trip out to Astoria
2,Its the house special and its incredible
2,2 orders of the Agrodolce Bacon with scallion ricotta and 1 order of the prosciutto with ricotta and fig jam
2,Prices were reasonable and inline with portion sizes.
2,Great for a romantic dinner
2,"Not sure if the brunch menu is better, but I don't think I'd go back for dinner."
2,Came on a Saturday around 1130
2,"This place is two different restaurants: a great pasta place, and a pretty crappy everything else place."
2,Staff incredibly friendly and efficient
2,If you are from out of town ask your friendsfamily that live in the area to take you here
2,Good food at reasonable prices in a beautiful restaurant with friends 
2,Whats not to like 
2,Had a lovely brunch here with friends
2,"Nice pasta, but slow slow slow service on a not very busy nightI just have returned back from Gastroteca."
2,"This restaurant is great , great food pasta and meat , great atmosphere and loa cation , I will be back soon I can Came here for brunch on a Sunday."
2,Three words: Portobello eggs Benedict!I'm always happy when a Brunch place has a good eggs Benedict.
2,Again five stars to Locale
2,"Good service, but food is pricey and the portions are ridiculously small."
2,A threefour brunch spot
2,"Service was pretty good, we got our orders relatively quick."
2,"When you go, you must save room for the peanut butter bomba."
2,The lounge area is intimate and cozy.
2,And their rosemary home fries are fantastic.
2,Would definitely come back since it is such an overall nice spot and service was relatively good.
2,"Nice, nice, nice.The physical space is nice, cozy, and feels like a slice of Brooklyn in Queens."
2,"I've also stopped in for dinner a couple of times and they do not disappoint.The waitstaff is always friendly, warm and knowledgeable about the menu, and the food is top notch.Locale is always on the top of my list of restaurants I recommend to friends new to the area."
2,Ambiance is very cool.
2,I'd go back in a heartbeat.
2,The Peanut Butter Bomba was the best guilty treat I ever had!
2,I definitely recommend the lamb ribs and the branzino
2,Poached eggs were perfect.
2,Went in without a reservation and got seated right away
2,Its just an awesome place all around
2,"Got the chicken and waffles, they should use chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, wasn't flavorful enough :/ Went here for brunch with family during the week and ate some pretty good chicken and waffle."
2,Very good first impression!
2,"Could have been better.Service - very nice, friendly and accommodating staff.The food is the only thing that was so-so."
2,Had a really great early dinner here last weekend.
2,The atmosphere is really pleasant and fun.
2,Whats the deal here
2,The environment is modern but comfortable and the staff is really pleasant and attentive.
2,Overall meh
2,I would recommend this place if you're in Astoria.
2,Drinks were delish and dessert was excellent.
2,Went here with a friend for brunch and had a decent meal
2,I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick brunch.
2,Fine point
2,Next time we'll try the arancini.
2,Only reason id recommend this place is to have their sugar dusted texas french toast  its a must try
2,I can see Gastroteca being one of my go-to brunch spots!
2,Anything truffle is amazing 
2,"Otherwise, it tasted pretty good."
2,"Portions are good, and quality is definitely there."
2,Shrimp grits was amazing too
2,My friend's Scampi & Grits tasted good too.
2,"This place has potential, but service is just so bad."
2,I highly recommend this Astoria hotspot in general but also for a special occasion
2,If you live in the area put this on your list
2,Its coming
2,Limited selection on the menu
2,"The crispy gnocchi was delicious as well, we really enjoyed the sauce it came in."
2,Came here for brunch on Sunday morning with my wife and my sister
2,Their brunch menu is something I'd love to check out as well!
2,The food was great until we each found hair in our food!!
2,Also for dessert the peanut butter bomba is a must try
2,Well worth the total bill nonetheless
2,There is definitely better brunch to be had in Astoria
2,The food is fresh and hormone free.
2,Been here many many times since my first review
2,Everyone is happy.
2,The lamb ribs appetizer was exceptional.
2,The food was phenomenal!
2,Great service to boot
2,I am guessing it was crack since I cannot wait to come back!
2,We have had everything on the mebu and it is fantastic
2,Great ambience nice waitress delicious food but kinda slow service
2,Let me start off by saying I don't think this place deserves less than a 4 star.
2,Definitely recommend this place and the next time we are in LIC visiting my sister we definitely want to try their dinner options
2,The location and the ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic.
2,Would highly recommend for a a quality place off the main roads in Astoria
2,The place itself is very cool.
2,Have no complaints
2,I would definitely come back here just for this carb overload.
2,Everything was made fresh and perfect for a Saturday brunch.
2,My Smoked Salmon Benedict was good.
2,"This place was cozy, especially in the back area."
2,And relatively cheap to boot
2,Saturday morning brunch at Locale with a few friends
2,Service was amazing and rumor has it that their coffee is amazing
2,The scampi & grits was an interesting combo too.
2,Meh indeed
2,Also ordered the Brunch Lasagna with bacon sausage bechamel mozzarella spinach with a fried egg on top
2,"We ordered three crostinis, artichoke, burrata - best one and a special goat cheese and beet which was also good."
2,"The restaurant was empty and service was attentive, but I cannot really get around the strangeness of the food."
2,The cocktails we ON POINT (the SkinnyGirl was fantastic) and our salads and apps were fantastic.
2,The restaurant is actually on a great corner with outdoor seating (if the weather is nice) and huge windows in the front that they'll open up sometimes.
2,The food was good- I had the baked eggs and my friend had the benedict with the pesto hollandaise.
2,One of me  my husbands favorite places for drinks
2,So the evening goes on and we had our entrees and everything was delicious.
2,I went to Locale with a friend on a Saturday night and we had a rather enjoyable experience.
2,Definitely worth a shot go check it out
2,Just nothing special either
2,Might come back sometime
2,Brunch is great too.--THE STORY--  I have been here and back a couple of times.
1,Table next to us food is brought out
1,"The server was attentive...but the place was not busy, so that wasn't too hard."
1,We all had the caramel apple pancakes and they were delicious
1,Went on Friday night my second visit as promised
1,I never had an empty coffee cupThis is definitely our new brunch spot
1,I recently went to Locale for Saturday brunch with an amazing fashionista from the locale
1,Just a joint best for weekend brunch on the food end
1,Have not been for brunch yet but Ive heard its amazing
1,So awesome!Food is very flavorful.
1,"and WAY over priced for the quality, but service was descent."
1,its well worth it
1,The food was hot and fresh and the service was out of this world!
1,The manager/hostess told us it would be a few minutes and suggested we grab a drink at the bar.
1,"It tasted good, but you could barely taste it."
1,Just the type of place I would want around the corner.
1,They do have good drinks but in my opinion they are kind of pricey
1,Its more expensive than your average neighborhood restaurant but I havent found a problem with the price
1,My risotto was bland and the calamari was overcooked
1,Its salad OR fries not both
1,Extremely disappointed with Locale
1,"My friend got the spinach and goat cheese omelet, and this was very strange."
1,Oh my god that chocolate sauce
1,Love the fresh pasta and the new fall menu
1,It was pretty stellar.
1,Minus two stars for service
1,The cheese and fruit platter is nothing special.
1,"Two orders of Smoked Salmon Benedict, one Eggs Benedict and one Prosciutto Panini (a daily special)."
1,From brunch to lunch to drinks everything is amazing
1,Minus one for food
1,I enjoyed the house salad and my boyfriend's gnocchi was phenomenal.
1,Another wonderful date restaurant in Astoria
1,not appetizing at all.Lastly the service is terrible.
1,Truly awesome dinner
1,The other dishes received good reviews as well.
1,Rigatoni Bolognese was well done
1,"I've eaten there several times, and the food is always excellent."
1,"I order the fried calamari, and my husband ordered the special app, sweet bread."
1,"All around, I had a very nice evening."
1,"The only negative thing is that the portions are kind of small, but we were very satisfied with our meals."
1,It's basically french toast with a cornflake coating.
1,The crepe special for the price was extremely tiny and filled with almost nothing.
1,So judge the prices by that.The service was incredible.
1,"The outdoor seating area was nice, on a perfect night, and inside the ambience and music seemed perfect for a date or a small gathering."
1,I totally recommend the Cheddar Polenta on the Brunch Menu along with a Passion Fruit Mimosa
1,"With all of the ""organic, free range"" ingredients they say they use, that was NOT grass-fed beef we had at our table.I doubt I'll come back here again."
1,The yucca was hard and dry.- beef short rib risotto.
1,The waitresses were very nice & helpful and the food was delicious & reasonably priced.
1,Both were nothing to write home about
1,"i thought the mushroom ravioli was delicious, but the artichoke ravioli was just mediocre (too creamy, and the artichoke could've been fresher)."
1,I've been here several times over the past 5 years of living in the area.
1,They were SO stingy with bread and olive oil it was ridiculous.
1,Nothing to write home about but Definitely get the sauce on the side
1,Their Tuscan french fries are delicious!!!!
1,i really enjoy the interior decor and style of this place nothing spectacular just nice and cozy and good looking
1,The risotto was on the bland side and the rice and just boring
1,"The location is fantastic; the wide sidewalk, trees, and relative quiet allows for pleasant sidewalk seating."
1,"I was looking forward to this night, and was dissapointed with my experience in this restaurant.Although the service was excellent we would never go back."
1,Their fish specials are always spectacular and the preparations are really original.
1,Average at best
1,omelet and crepe special
1,What a lovely restaurant
1,Not here it is really clean all around.
1,It really hit the spot
1,I ordered eggs benedict with corned beef hash and my friend had french toast filled with Nutella.
1,The service is very friendly except their service is little slow.
1,It was so amazing it was hot and it had the right amount of cheese and spinach not too overwhelming
1,My friends and I had brunch here just yesterday for my birthday and it was so phenomenal!
1,The belgian waffles that my husband ordered wasn't that special either.
1,Very slow to take the order and bring the food
1,Its good food in a comfortable atmosphere
1,Food is pretty good although I found the service friendly but completely clueless.
1,You could barely taste the polenta.
1,"As I mentioned the restaurant is very cute, it is a bit small but the ambiance is perfect."
1,I got a spinach and goat cheese omelette that was surprisingly good.
1,The pasta with gorgonzola and a red beet sauce was delicious.
1,I have only had dessert and drinks here but everything was fantastic.
1,"For our entree's we had the beef short rib risotto, which was VERY heavy and tasted like something you would find in a can of chef boyardee."
1,Try it sometimes
1,"My husband had the special, the duck."
1,"tables on the front bottom level, and couch style seating on the upper back level, although the tables are still high so you're not bending over your food."
1,Not a great first impression.
1,Iced coffee yay
1,"But do not be misled, it is not good."
1,nice breezy decor
1,If the do soup specials get them because they are always great.
1,The waiter service was sub-par and for that I can't give this place a 5 star rating.
1,Just thinking about the fresh pasta lamb ragu and cheese makes my mouth water
1,The crispy zucchini is addictive.
1,oh and as for prices totally reasonable gotta love dining in an outer boroughall in all i highly recommend this place
1,I could probably live on the crispy zucchini for months.
1,"As for the food, the gnocchi is incredibly delightful and the antipasti appetizer is top notch -- I just can't get enough of this place!"
1,Our waitress gave good recommendations on what to order.
1,**OVERALL**  Ambiance is casual and quiet most nights.
1,The food has been moderate to great.
1,"Not only is the decor charming and the service pleasant, but the food is absolutely incredible."
1,Locale has a great decor and the bartender was so helpful.
1,The dessert was forgettable and unimpressive as well.
1,THANK YOUUU
1,It is distinctive and delicious
1,It was very tasty and the portion was just right.
1,"They served amazing food (sliders, stuffed mushrooms, and bruschetta) and drinks (the mojito is great!)."
1,"!Overall great staff, delicious food and casual yet trendy ambiance."
1,A great neighborhood restaurant
1,"Nice atmosphere, prices I'd say average for the area."
1,Thank you Locale
1,vintage and spacious
1,Beef sliders aged angus stuffed mushrooms vegetarian and bruschetta
1,The vibe of the restaurant is nonchalant and chill.
1,"Not sure if the chef is Italian or not, but definitely better Italian in Astoria."
1,Servings are small too.
1,Anything you order is amazingblack linguine is amazing
1,The salads are amazing
1,Very nice place for dinner.
1,The branzino dish was flavorful and cooked to perfection.
1,"The meal was exceptional, tasty and hot on arrival."
1,"In fact, the last time I went there this last weekend it was so epic, I had to write this review."
1,"All three were out of this world, its my new favorite restaurant...  stop reading this and go there, NOW!!!"
1,"My boyfriend had a coffee, very good nothing spectacular."
1,The hostess told us to take a seat at the bar for coffee and drinks and we would be seated at a table as soon as it was available - perfect!
1,"Sidewalk seating, great!"
1,Came here on a Friday night w the BF
1,There are like 56 dinner tables inside a full bar a back lounge area with couches and some tables and also outside seating
1,"But with all the other options in the area, I may try something else..."
1,I'll definitely be going back if I ever find myself stranded in Astoria and at a loss for where to go.
1,Perfect place for a date or with friends for a classy simple dinner without traveling out of Astoria
1,Perfect for outdoor dining
1,Ive never been disappointed before herebut this meal stunk
1,I also recommend the beet and goat cheese salad
1,"The Paparedella was OK, the short rib rissoto was good at first, but after a while you get bored of the taste, the Rigotoni was quite hard and was not worth it and the organic chicken was so dry."
1,"Unfortunately, the egg was the best part."
1,This was just flat.
1,"For our entrees we ordered the Paparedella, Short rib Rissoto, Organic Chicken and the Rigotoni, All of the pasta dishes were very heavy."
1,"The braised meatballs were pretty good and the salad was well, a salad."
1,The Lolita was pretty good.
1,"If you can't be good at your job, you should at least be kind."
1,You can't go wrong with any of the eggs Benedicts--the food here is AMAZING!!
1,"We even got dessert wine on the house at the end!Overall, a great experience - I will definitely come back."
1,Little Pricy for the portions but service was great!
1,"Not to mention a lot of their food is organic, free range or grass fed."
1,Mimosa was flat...not bubbly.
1,BUT the service and atmosphere are seriously worth it.
1,The wine list is weak and the food is not memorable.
1,"My girlfriend's avocado and tomato benedict was delicious also-- I love how they have super vegetarian friendly, and many, versions of the benedict."
1,As a rule and somewhat habit I always get their fish specials the fish is always cooked perfectly and has a sauce that always compliments the natural flavor instead of masking it
1,and drinks are especially yummy.
1,His pasta was delicious and everything was HOT (temperature) which was a great!
1,Their brunch polenta and artichoke ravioli
1,"It wasn't the most exciting thing in the world, however, and I found myself somewhat envying my boyfriend's brunch lasagna (béchamel, bacon, sausage, spinach, mozzarella, fried egg), which is really a unique concoction."
1,"The sauce and quality of the mussels are truly delicious, as is all of the food."
1,"I went for the Queens Restaurant Week special, so options were a little limited but everything I had was very good."
1,"I feel like for the price, there are many other establishments in Astoria that would be a better choice for brunch."
1,"Although the food was great, delicious and well prepared, we felt that the portions were a little bit on the small side for their price."
1,"I'll def be coming back, hopefully their other dishes are good as well!"
1,One of the sexier Astoria spots
1,"Ok, I ordered the California Benedict with a side salad and all I can say is that those egg Benedict's were really good!"
1,However if I ever find myself in Astoria or if someone asks me for a recommendation this will definitely be it
1,"I come for lunch, drinks then dinner."
1,Their cheese plates are yummy.
1,I wish I could remember her name.
1,"The food was good but they took more than half hr to serve the food, even there was few tables only."
1,Esp the chicken and waffles
1,For brunch plates run about $12-15 and are not worth it.
1,Better options in the area
1,Not too spicy but definitely a kick
1,Went on a whim on a Tuesday afternoon for brunch and really liked the food and atmosphere
1,Yes  I am definitely a fan of Locale
1,the decor is cute and I like how they project movies on the wall behind the bar.
1,I really liked the open layout and that the tables weren't so close together.
1,It was cooked to perfection and super tasty
1,"See for yourself, the pictures are as great as the amazing taste."
1,What a big big big disappointment.
1,Enjoy xoxo This was the worst brunch experience I have ever had for both the service and the food in Astoria
1,Can you say overrated
1,shrimps n grits The food was good !
1,Good variety of inventive omelets cool space reasonable prices
1,I went with my friend for the first time and the dish I ordered tastes amazing
1,Absolutely amazing restaurant and Im pickyI had the salmon which is Scottish so much more flavorful than Atlantic or Alaskan salmon
1,"I am so glad since like I mentioned, the food there is really amazing as is the decor and table service."
1,The lobster ravioli was delicious!
1,The servers and bartenders are super sweet!
1,Stopped by for brunch recently
1,Not too spicy but adds just enough
1,"The service I received was awful, our waiter was curt, brought our food out late and cold, and was very inattentive."
1,The passion mimosa was delish.
1,"the friendly, efficient service is a definite plus, too."
1,Really good bloody marys and mimosas to compliment your brunch!
1,I havent been here for dinner yet but looking forward to it
1,Decor is attractive.
1,Overall pretty solid
1,"Our server was really attentive, and I loved sitting next to the big front windows."
1,This place over charged for just sub par food
1,Its a nice place to bring a friend to though as its not too loud or crowded to have a conversation and catch up with someone
1,Definitely a super cool spot for brunch with instagrammable decor  looking forward to coming back for dinner
1,It was not loud in there definitely easy have a conversation and catch up with a friend
1,It seemed like everyone was pretty happy with their food and it was definitely a very lively place.
1,We sat at the bar and had some really good cocktails before we had dinner it was a perfect night at a great spot.
1,My friend and I both ordered iced coffees which were refreshing but you know iced coffee
1,The selection is wonderful and not pricey.
1,Had dinner a couple of times and was happy then too
1,"Prices were standard, and waitress was friendly."
1,My same thoughts are echoed to the salmon dish.Service was excellent.
1,It was delicious but the hollandaise was a bit sharp
1,Nothing to complain about but nothing remarkable either - pretty much what you would expect for the price point.
1,Great vibe to Locale
1,Very quaint and intimate
1,Other than that I had an excellent experience at Gastroteca  would definitely try this spot again
1,"They usually have a long list of specials (almost too many specials if there's such a thing, not so special when there are more specials than what's on the menu, no?)."
1,All in all I dont need to go back to Gastroteca
1,"I had the salmon crostino, which wasn't bad."
1,I've walked past it so many times and always thought it looked charming.
1,The home fries we got with the salmon was a nice salty and sweet combo.
1,We would definitely try this place again but not too often since it is expensive for us.
1,The friendly professional waitstaff and great food may have made Locale a new neighborhood spot for us!
1,Server was very knowledgeable about the menu and their food.
1,Gastroteca is great new edition restaurant in Astoria.
1,She admitted that she was not sure and went down to confirm with the chef.
1,I had the spaghetti in a tomato Sauce with burrata cheese melted on top.
1,It didn't seem like much on the plate but it was very rich and the beef just melted in your mouth.
1,Equally awesome service
1,Their Bloody Marys and Passion mimosas are a must have
1,I would recommend the restaurant any day!
1,Very knowledgeable about the menu extremely professional courteous attentive and provides A quality service
1,Its a brunch must
1,Thanks for a great afternoon Gastroteca
1,"I ordered steak and eggs, it was really good, right temperature."
1,The eggs Benny was really good.
1,Worst experience ever
1,The pasta was freshly made and the lamb was good!
1,I thought maybe the lack of cheese was why my sandwich was so bland but my friend who ate the sandwich with cheese also found the meal tasteless
1,They looked and smelled amazing
1,The food was awesome and the menu was so interesting it was difficult to choose what to order.
1,I was seated in the lower tables next to the upper level
1,Brunch at 4Had the poached eggs
1,Cant win
1,Those were crispy and seasoned well
1,"But meh, the rest left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,I really had wanted to come here for dinner originally but after my experience with brunch that won't be happening.Bottom line: Both of us left hangry and I won't be coming back since there are TONS of better options on 30th Avenue that offer much better food deals for brunch *cough* William Hallet *cough* Queens Comfort *cough* Locale is the kind of place that presents a serious dilemma: Do I come here for dinner or do I come here for drinks at the bar and lounge area?
1,Its a solid choice for brunch or any other meal or drinks
1,Checked in for 10 off total bill
1,Locale for drinks only
1,The seating is very close together and open.
1,Brussels sprouts salad nice.
1,Cozy and fun ambiance
1,"I got the poached eggs with biscuits and gravy and I honestly thought I'd get a side of b&g, but it was just a small portion of 2 biscuit halves with eggs on it and a spoonful of gravy on each."
1,"That's how good this meal was Nice ambience, very helpful bar staff - but the food is a little uneven."
1,"Horrible, horrible experience with extremely mediocre food."

1,"Locale may be one of my favorite Astoria restaurants...I absolutely loved my experience.First, the space is really cute."
1,"The food was good, but the portions were small, and the pasta dishes were not served with any bread."
1,It was used as a garnish on the salmon and it was really good!
1, Where do I start
1,"A brunch spot for old friends catching up last minute, we went without reservations but were seated immediately at the bar."
1,High five to the chef
1,Poached eggs with biscuits and gravy and the Begian waffles for me off the menu
1,The waffle brunch was delicous.
1,"The polenta was very salty, I think it was the breadcrumbs."
1,"Definitely give it a go.10% off bill if you check in, which I forgot to do because I was too busy figuring out what to eat."

1,Only positive thing I can say is that we were able to get 10% off the bill using the Yelp app.
1,"The selection was pretty good, we went with the eggs benedict and the potatoes."
1,McDonalds is around the corner if you want fast food

1,Outside seating with huge spacious tables and couches inside.
1,We called to make sure they were good to go and let them know we would be on our way.
1,The crostini was delicious but maybe we were just ravenous.
1,For dinner we split the appetizer trio of bruschetta 10 Fig Jam Ricotta and Prosciutto  Kind of a standard toast spread it was tasty but not the best of the bunch
1,I highly recommend the Freddy Kruger bloody Mary it is a blood Mary with the addition of jalapeno infused vodka which gives it an extra kick and will wake you up right away
1,Great servers terrible manager 
1,Gotta go if youre in the area and worth the trip if not
1,Again small portions  heavy dish
1,The Locale Faggotini Beggers purse shaped pasta stuffed with gorganzola topped with walnuts in a red beet sauce
1,"I have now been here several times,  to include ringing in the New Year,  and it is hand's down,  my favorite spot in Astoria."
1,The toast it came with did taste good and the extra order of the side of American bacon I ordered tasted amazing
1,"It would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks The Nutella French Toast Bread Pudding was too good, and so was the sea bass and rosemary chicken."

1,It's a little off from central Astoria so it's not usually overcrowded...particularly when the weather is nice since you can sit outside.
1,They had quite a few pasta dishes on the menu that looked amazing but then there was a polenta dish that also looked great
1,My girlfriend ordered the California Benedict (which comes with avocado and roasted tomato) and that was pretty good.

1,Place was packed for brunch.STEAK AND EGGS WERE THE BEST I'VE TASTED IN QUEENS.!!

1,Bechamel sauce bacon sausage spinach and mozzarella all baked together in breakfast matrimony and topped with a fried egg
1,Full price on everything
1,The eggs and portbello just melted in your mouth as you eat it
1,the bf's chicken club has cheese-covered bread and sliced chicken breast (instead of whole chicken breast) and it's much more manageable to go with all the other ingredients.
1,If you want to eat something delicious do not come here
1,they looked and smelled amazing
1,The chicken was crispy yet tender and the maple butter was an especially nice touch.
1,"I have always done brunch here with the outdoor sitting its really nice.The service is good, all the waiters are very nice, they always bring water to my dog!"
1,It was like a warm blanket and I ordered their Blue cheese burger that were accompanied by the most delicious hand cut fries that were completely addicting.
1,Everything Ive tried here so far has been amazing
1,Definitely recommend getting the home fries on the side the portions are a little on the small side in comparison to brunch places nearby
1,I have been here with large groups and just for date night and their service and food is consistent.
1,"Located on a pretty, tree-lined street in Astoria, the cuisine is northern Italian; the ambiance is rustic hip; the service is impeccable, and the food is delectable and creative."
1,We ordered the California Benedict which was perfectly cooked and the French toast was sinfully sweet in the best way.

1,"Great to sit outside, the street isn't too busy and the inside is also nice."
1,I had the pesto cavatelli and my friend had the blue crab spaghettini.
1,I believe it was slightly over priced.
1,My friend had a seafood dish that I can't remember the name of but I can remember the taste!
1,I thought the mimosa was very bland which was disappointing
1,Such a cool atmosphere too
1,The waffle itself was chewy and soft and the fried chicken was flavorful.
1,Definitely pair this with their home fries
1,As long as the mimosas keep coming you stop paying attention to something as pesky as time right
1,Wooooo hoooo win win she found a parking spot right out front and we sat at a cute table because we didnt have a reservation
1,For our entrees we had the truffle gnocchi which was delicious and creamy

1,Topped with fresh berries and powdered sugar
1,Delicious and light yet filling
1,Its my goto neighborhood restaurant for that special occasion girls night out or morning after brunch
1,Our waitress did a great job with recommendations.
1,"The fried eggplants had a thin crust, a bit dry, but the eggplants were very moist and watery, and the burrata was simply tasty and refreshing, which added moisture to the bread."
1,"With the moisture given from the eggplants and burrata cheese, you wouldn't feel very dry or hard to swallow."
1,And it was served with hand cut fries that were not done
1,"The waitress was super accommodating and the restaurant was beautiful... Had outdoor seating, nice vibes... Definitely somewhere I would visit again for a few drinks."
1, slices of smoked Atlantic salmon and 2 sunny side eggs
1,"I had the pleasure of dining at Locale with a group of 11 on a Saturday afternoon and the food, drinks, service and decor were all top-notch."
1,My entire plate was FANTASTIC.
1,I would go back in a heartbeat and try other things and take a few friends when they visit.
1,My other friends ordered the regular omelette and loved that as well.
1,We ordered shaved Brussels sprouts to start  delicious
1,"But nonetheless, I can appreciate generous quantities of food."
1,"The sauce was perfectly seasoned and the texture of the fresh made pasta was so great, perfectly al dente."
1,Their servings are quite small for the price and ours tasted watered down.
1,"We ordered the following:Smoked Atlantic Salmon Crostino ($13.50): the salmon came on a huge toast but I thought the toast was a bit too hard to chew.Belgian Waffles ($12.00): banana caramel sauce, walnut, and whipped cream on top of a huge waffle!"
1,Perfect brunch spot for delicious cocktails and somewhat new take on brunch inspired dishes.
1,Love the shaved truffle
1,"Besides this faux pas incident, the food was beautifully presented but needed more flavour."
1,They gave us a comfy table for two in the back elevated area that was very cozy.
1,Portions I will say for $15-20 dishes are pretty small as hell.
1,Been here for brunch on more than one occasion and was never disappointed
1,All of them were freshly made according to the menu
1,Good menu with a variety of choices
1,Where to start
1,We sat at the bar because the tables are full.

1,The taste was very good and you can tell that the calamari was fresh.
1,One of the best restaurants in the AstoriaLong Island CitySunnyside neighborhood
1,My meal was very good with a good mixture of seafood and sauces.
1,We arrive and there were several open tables and literally no one waiting.
1,They also offer a great brunch menu here which Im definitely coming back
1,"Came here for brunch while trying to put off the Sunday Scaries and this place was so excellent it had me thinking it was Saturday.Bloody Mary aficionados will love the Freddy Kreuger, Gastroteca's spicier take on the drink, made with jalapeno infused vodka."
1,Nice big windows and opportunities to sit outside in the good weather
1,Love the huge glass exterior giving the place a very NYC type of vibe
1,"Overall, I thought the service and ambiance were nice."
1,Got a seat right away which was really nice.
1,Only stopped by for a small bite and happy hour
1,"If i lived here, I'd be here all the time."
1,We got caught in some traffic and called to let them know we were en route however would be a little late to our reservation
1,"I don't know if I'll ever go back but if I do, I'm definitely checking to see if there are any price changes."

0,"Family visit after Moving images museum.My old kid tried Ragu and liked it.My wife ordered crispy gnocchi and loved it.I ordered carbonara and it was not so good (that's why 3 stars only), I gave my wife to try and she did not like it as well.The service was good,The atmosphere is very nice.We are probably spoiled in ny... so I would recommend this place but may be ask fir recommendations from the staff."
0,I came here last night with a friend after we realized we were both starving to death.
0,"(Based on the Yelp reviews and our experience here, Gastroteca is a popular spot for events with large groups."
0,"For my entrée I ended up going with the Crispy Gnocchi ($16): Pistachio pesto, spinach, and a liberal amount of shredded ricotta salata adorned on top."
0,"By the way I thought the home fries had more flavor than the California benedict.The only thing I would say that is good about this place is the decor, and their toast with nutella which was delicious."
0,Nice little spot near Kaufman theater
0,My mushroom omelet was a fine omelet but the fries on the side were greasy and limp.
0,Its a great place to spend a Sunday morning
0,"We had to wait over 20 minutes to have it changed, and the cocktail fell very short of its description."
0,Plenty of people chatting and on top of that loud music
0,Service is good albeit I went at a very not busy time.
0,The dish was flavorful and I enjoyed the crispy exterior of the gnocchi which you dont typically find

0,Not going back will speak to the owner

0,"Meanwhile, we had brunch at a nearby French place on 36th Ave earlier in the day and even in tightly packed quarters with rapidly demanded orders and a BARELY there mess up with a menu item mixed up that took about 20 seconds to correct, and one chef making allll of the orders, the hostess and server were highly attentive, greeted us with friendly attitudes, let us WAIT for a table to open up, and comped some brunch drinks to make up for the slight wait on the item mix up."
0,Sadly there were a lot of low points during our mealFirst impression its loud
0,"At the end, the waitress was kind and patient enough split the bill on three cards for us."
0,Each bite was very flavorful and tasty.
0,I would have to go try some of the other stuff another time =)As always check some of the photos that I always post =) I really wanted to love Gastroteca.
0,Then he basically says something along the lines of reservation right
0,"Their Mmm mmm mimosa was perfect, their homemade Bloody Mary even passed my boyfriend's standards, and the food was incredible."
0,No flavor whatsoever
0,How do you now know what drink you brought usWe never saw a waiter other than to deliver food or to pick up empty glasses

0,Stracchino garlic mushrooms  My personal favorite and definitely the most flavored with a rich thick soft cows cheese
0,(when more than half of the tables appear open) and if we say no he just tosses the menus away and shoots a glare as if we are peons that he can't help.
0,It's not the boozey I'm going to get you crunked under the table style brunch but they have delicious rustic Italian foods with a modern twist that they claim all endorse fresh ingredients found locally in Astoria.
0,"The powder sugar was just sweet enough, then to dip just a bit of the toast in the syrup to really change it."
0,Under seasoned etc
0,Then turns on his heel and dismisses us
0,If we ask how long it might be to wait otherwise he rolls his eyes and points at the bar as if it is a dentention center and tells us it's an option.
0,Lately this place is just ridiculous.
0,"When we got our food, it wasn't cold, but cold enough to tell that it has been sitting on the counter for sometime.Service-Super nice!"
0,Bravo to the chef
0,"From the street, I think I walked past this place like 4x before I realized the restaurant on the corner with the red awning was Gastroteca..LOL I didn't see a sign or anything that said Gastroteca on it..OR perhaps I need to open my eyes more.. O_O Interior decor was simple and clean."
0,Excellent atmosphere!Astoria is a new neighborhood for me and I had a chance to come here for Saturday brunch.Food-very good!
0,And there weren't odd rules about reservations or waiting for a table.
0,Ever meet someone who you knew was just looking for a fight
0,I dont think Ive ever had it that good
0,My fiance's brunch lasagna had underdone pasta and was rather dry (not surprising as there's no real sauce to speak of) and small.
0,Came with a party of five for lunch during the week
0,Eggs Benedict is a brunch staple and if you can't execute that right maybe you shouldn't have it on your menu.
0,I would try a different drink.
0,This is a neighborhood restaurantAnyways still lovers of the food and service otherwise we went ahead and made a reservation this week
0,We also had delicious mimosas and a friendly bar tender
0,But meanwhile several items (including menu items that were in our order) are promptly delivered to the table seated after us.
0,So we settle otherwise for the high top bar tables (aka- see above: detention center for folks made to feel dumb for not making a reservation).Fine.
0,"But the brunch lasagna was so so, the lasagna layer had more to do with toughness and it served with warm temperature only, I believe it will taste much better if they serve it hot."
0,Service was quick up until we ordered dessert.
0,He shows us the worst table (so much for the privilege of making a reservation) and when we ask if we can sit up in the other section he says it's for larger parties.
0,The side salad was just lettuce and vinaigrette dressing; refreshing but not satisfying or very tasty (next time I'll try the hash browns since they seemed to be the popular side that day).
0,"I can make myself an omelet (and frankly, a better french fry) and my home has a calmer atmosphere."
0,Two of us loved our entree and the others were not crazy about it.
0,"Scampi was really good to mix with the creamy cheese, the shrimp wasn't over cook, !!"
0,My husband ordered the gnocchi and I must admit that's probably the best gnocchi I've tasted!
0,Ours came out al dente and amazing but for the folks who ordered the linguine with clams the consensus was it was super salty.
0,Customer service goes a long way people!!!
0,Honestly this place was beyond mediocre.
0,We had a reservation for 100pm on Memorial Day
0,Greeted by the same rude as ever staffer maybe manager
0,hard to tell again we say yup reservation this time the place was packed as it was Saturday night so made sense this time and the only tables open are one right by the door in the middle of the room and two others up in the elevated section
0,So lets start from the beginning
0,Lots of spice but not enough flavor  sort of watery
0,Which was especially disappointing because of its 4 star status and fairly good reviews.
0,One downside is that the portion size is very small and I would recommend ordering one or two sides because the gnocchi by itself was not filling for my husband.
0,I think next time I'll ask for a little extra sauce.
0,But try not to make it so obvious that service at other tables suffer as a result
0,Everyone's food was unmemorable and unexciting.
0,Be gracious and sympathetic about it at least if you seriously are so piled up with reservations that theres no way in for a decade
0,This table nazi stuff is such a turn off.
0,"It cute cause they even put that sparkler thingy on it.This place is great, highly recommended."
0,But seems like a tone is being set- mainly by door guy host manager fella that is just setting up each experience for failure.
0,:D Very nice place near Kaufman studios and The Museum of the Moving Image.
0,98 juice
0,Definitely unworthy of four stars regarding their brunch
0,Were loyal friendly easy to please well tipping customers
0,Legit annoyed at the recent changes here
0,Inside was airy and very bright.
0,I go there so much it's almost embarrassing.
0,A rustic decor with large windows to let in natural light and 80s rock playing in the background
0,"The zeppoles were very tasty and quite dense/rich, probably the best part of our meal."
0,Something to consider if you like your eggplant extra saucey
0,"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but a few favorites are the kale salad, steak, and salmon."
0,But my girlfriend ordered the Bucatini Americano and it was delicious
0,A must have on the weekday brunch menuWe also ordered crostinos the prosciuttoricottafig jam agrodolce baconscallion ricotta and tallegiopistachiosblackberry jam
0,Then nothing.No offer for additional drinks or dessert (they always do here)... No check drop.
0,The person on the phone was extremely rude and said they couldn't hold our table for much longer bc they had a lot of people waiting to be seated.
0,So if it wasn't for the food I could well have given them 2 stars.
0,Maybe I am just generous tonight?troteca Astoria I'm here now having dinner with my fiance for our anniversary.
0,"Then we ask a very helpful server (not ours, couldn't find her) if the food is coming, she helps, some food comes, other server and good service kick back in again- all great."
0,Especially when in plain view
0,"It didn't leave me craving more but it was decent, filling and the waitress was attentive."
0,If youre within a couple blocks and its open its worth checking out
0,"I came for brunch and had a shandy followed by two Moscow Mules and was definitely feeling the after effects, so don't let the cocktail prices set you off even though brunch drinks are typically a little cheaper.My friends got the fried chicken and waffles and the chicken sandwich, all of which were devoured."
0,We also had to send my brothers cheese omelet back because they forgot to put cheese on it... wtf.
0,"Overall....it was okayThe decor is cute and trendish - ya know, expose brick walls, nice long bar, high ceilings and windows everywhereThe food was mediocre."
0,Deliciousness
0,"My faggatoni was heavily cheesy, but so delicious I still ate almost the whole plate!"
0,"The ""Smooch"" was heavier but the peach, strawberry, and mint complimented each other beautifully.Others at the table tried the ""Writer's Block"" which was a bit heavy but oh-so-literary, and the ""Class"" which was exactly what they should be drinking on Mad-Men.The calamari were a little rubbery, but everything else I tried was excellent."
0,"The cocktails are inventive and mysterious--even the manager wouldn't tell us what was in the de-lish-usss ""Lolita,"" which was light, refreshing, and garnished with an orchid."
0,Not chewy or overcooked at all
0,I dont live in Astoria but have some friends in the area so when we went out to check out the new chefs work and new cocktail menu I didnt know what to expect but everything I had was great
0,"The mojitos are great, and the food is excellent (except that one time when my pasta was not al dente, it was closer to crunchy.)"
0,Thought you were talking to me lol
0,"If you live in the area, you must make it here and I have even had friends from other boroughs make the trip."
0,The drinks are extra cost to the menu and were lousy.
0,Someone said the water was the best lol you can get that at the hydrant on the corner for free.
0,The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive as well.On a recent Visit we were very unhappy with our entrees.
0,I had the rigatoni with eggplant which was very bland and barely had any flavor
0,You honestly cant go wrong......and i guess i have a spot in my heart for locale because this is my boyfriend and i first dinner date place .....must try!
0,The waitress realized something was off as we barely ate any of our food and after speaking to someone in charge comped us a $10 appetizer.
0,"I know, the beet sauce sounds weird but it's sooo good.Really cute little place, but if you go during prime dinner time, be prepared to wait."
0,"They were playing an old Audrey Hepburn movie in the back, there was quiet jazz playing and low lighting - perfect for a date night."
0,I got the veal meatballs and the crostini deal 3 for 10so delicious

0,"The money is going to ingredients that although add to the dish... they aren't necessary to make taste buds sing with joy!theres a pretty long wine list, which was shocking to me because I dont associate wine with QueensIts not very spacious and the place can get pretty loudBut you really ought to go for the food and try this place out-- its this secret gem in Astoria because its got pretty much nothing else fun to do/see/go to in its immediate area I have been in Astoria for a few years now and have been to Locale on a few different occasions."

0,"We had a waitress the other night on Tuesday night, and she was so sweet and knew the answers to all my roommates questions."
0,Tables good for two or groups all around

0,"I'm pretty sure the menu changes often because I don't currently see what I ate on their online menu, nevertheless, anything you order here is going to be fresh and taste amazing (pasta is made fresh on site).Locale has an impressive wine and cocktail list and everything on the menu is reasonably priced.I believe our waitress's name was Anna (blonde hair) and she was absolutely fantastic!"
0,"The menu offered interesting brunch cocktails, but we didn't order any."

0,Anna the waitress and Jeremy the bartender are fantastic and provide memorable service and dining experiences.
0,"Their homefries are amazing.I've been here several times with groups for brunch, and have to say my friends have all said this is one of their favorite places.Only drawback is that drinks are not included in the Brunch prices like a lot of other places do.At night the mood turns a little bit like a club, and is loud."
0,The tagliatelle bolognese was really fresh and good as well.
0,I eventually had to ask her if she could get us something.

0,Eggs benedict were a tad overdone and corn beef hash was good but not great.
0,"No fine print, but servers rejected because our party was larger than 4."
0,"Normally restaurants include promotion details with their offers.Verdict: Quality of food was acceptable, service and culinary abilities were subpar."
0,My 2nd time here
0,"And i must say, their fish (bronzino) is delicious."
0,Not once making eye contact
0,Otherwise plenty of other restaurants in Astoria with comparable decor to try
0,(which was also lukewarm...some ice would have been nice given that it was 90+ degrees out)Food was overall pretty bland.
0,they coat it in corn flakes so its crunchy and delicious
0,It could have used more spices and seasonings.
0,Chicken was apparently dry and fries were just okay and seemed like they were old and the last of the batch.
0,"Anyway, I would give it another try but I'm not going for brunch again."
0,We were sat at the corner table with a couch
0,"Light was dim, decor was classical yet artfully modern."
0,"Multiple servers would ask how we were numerous times, gave us fresh shaved cheese, and a free dessert just because."
0,"Also, I'm not a big fan of drinks that  you have to point to because they are trying to be funny (i.e.thepantydropper) though the beverage itself is pretty tasty.But all in all, Locale is a great restaurant and a must visit if you are in the Astoria food scene."
0,Biggest turn off is waiting an hour for brunch when you're already hangry.
0,I swear I tasted bacon and eggs in this but maybe I'm just crazy.
0,"Fun place for a brunch or dinner Nice looking, good vibe place with decent food.The staff (not everyone) borderline being snob which is a drag.This place is pure windows so in the winter it tends to be cold and maybe because the staff is running back and forth they dont fell it like us who are sitting down."
0,"Their food (and cake cutting fee...) may be somewhat on the more expensive side (except brunch) but for the most part, it is worth it."
0,I'm so happy now to see that Locale really does care about their customers.
0,We split the banana ricotta zepoles which was probably too much food but they were delicious as well

0,"The location of this place is in a very unusual spot in the middle of bodegas and whatnot, but I think business does just fine."
0,The atmosphere in this place is very quant and swanky.
0,We always over-order because there are so many great options on the menu.
0,Unfortunately I dont believe its on the menu anymore
0,"It was not warm, and the spinach tasted raw.Both orders were barely seasoned, and so lacking in flavor."

0,I wasn't sure we could pull off a last minute brunch date for 6 people but we did without having to wait.
0,"This restaurant has a nice physical space, and the staff were all cheerful, but the food disappointed."

0,"The food is very tasty, not too impressed with their egg dishes."
0,"Our server was impressively speedy, which worked well for us because we were in a hurry, but I do wonder if this is a good place for a languid brunch.I decided to try the scampi & grits (shrimp, sausage, tomato, peppers, polenta, eggs)."
0,My experiences have been great with the exception of the occasional order mixup or serious delay in getting something done.
0,"and breakfast items, and/or b) they would bring back their omelet and breakfast specials!"
0,"They mostly have the usual breakfast and brunch fare plus somewhat unique additions (polenta with sausage and fried egg), but it is a slim menu."
0,It's especially nice when it's warm out.
0,Not only is the environment depending on where you sit comfortable and elegant at the same time but frankly the quality of the food has improved over time particularly the omelets and egg benedicts
0,"The prices are a bit steep for Queens standards, but I don't think you will regret it."
0,My boyfriend had the italian benedict and enjoyed it a lot as well.
0,The combination seems weird but it's super tasty and the perfect amount of food.
0,Thanks Locale - your manager is great One star is based on atmosphere and service only.
0,"Don't forget to use your 10% off coupon through Yelp because I totally did but I'd be willing to give the restaurant another shot, pats Yelp app lovingly."

0,The steak frites were delicious as well.
0,Lots of inventive daily specials which I like.
0,Its basically a chocolate shell filled with peanut cream quartered and then drizzled with chocolate sauce and caramel
0,Service was pretty fast and excellent so I am not sure what all the other yelpers are complaining about.
0,I am DEFINITELY hooked
0,"The pastas were great, and I appreciate the ""proper"" portions that were served, but for the prices of $16 and $19, I would expect a bit more for my money, or for the prices to be a bit lower."
0,"Our server suggested the Calamari as an excellent starter, and although I wanted to try something different for a change, we decided to go with it since she said it was really good."
0,"I feel like 3 little stars isn't very fair, but anyway..Decided to try Locale for dinner the other night, since I was pretty optimistic about it after I had looked up their menu online.I made a reservation for a Friday night at 8:30- we were running 10 mins late so I called ahead to notify the restaurant, and they gracefully accommodated us."
0,After tonight I am definitely a new regular
0,"Not ideal to have that many tables blocked off and have slow service, but everyone has those busy times so I get it."
0,This place has the best frozen Patron margarita I've ever had.
0,It was so delicious and my two year old niece approved!
0,I just wish that it would have come with eggs I had to order them separately which whopped up my food cost to 16 bux.
0,My sister had a chicken club sandwich that was dry and had slightly burnt toast.
0,the hanger steak was also good but we both felt that nobody  beats peter lugers when it comes to steaks Solid brunch.
0,"Servers walked by repeatedly, and no one else stopped at our table to greet us, give us menus or to tell us how long it would be until our server would be there."
0,When I got there they did not have my reservation and happened to have one table available outside with only one chair
0,"She wishes she would have gotten the California eggs benedict she had been debating over, the people next to us had them and they looked so tasty."

0,"So cute, our waiter was great (he even gave us a free dessert), and so close to my apartment!"
0,their soups are great- it's a damn shame they no longer serve soup at brunch.

0,"portion was extremely small, food not hot, gravy bland, biscuits dense and flavorless."
0,The food was good and ambience was chill until I got a whiff of stinky feet.
0,That's when I saw that the person's sitting on the top level's feet was next to my food.
0,in what world are 2 eggs more costly than a serving of chicken
0,"My boyfriend had the fettucini and lamb sausage, which he could not get enough of."
0,and a chicken cali club 10 but cali benedict 12
0,its a bag and hot water people
0,"the black bean soup and corn chowder was amazing...but it's a moot point since it's not on the regular menu...speaking of brunch....first time i was here i thought the eggs benedict were the best i ever had- mainly because of their hollandaise, but it's never been very good since- either served cold, yolk cooked through, the english muffin tasting old and stale, or the overall portion being ridiculously small."
0,"papardelle with rabbit was good, the others first bite was great and was so heavy it was just overwhelming to eat and enjoy."
0,It's never that crowded yet you can never find a server and the food always takes forever.
0,"Had I been writing this review last year, it'd be 5 stars hands down, but no lie this place has gone DOWNNNN, wayyy dowwnnn!!!!"
0,"For drinks my boyfriend had a pumpkin based cocktail and the bold fashioned, both of which were really delicious and unique."
0,"Just another low key place with good drinks, great vibe, and killin it with the food."

0,I had a drink with gin cucumber dill and olive brine which was absolutely amazing
0,"The waiter was extremely attentive, and took the time to answer all our questions and to walk me through the Italian wines on the menu as we ate at an off time and he had few other customers."
0,"The place is beautiful with huge glass windows, lots of white tile and marble, and painted tin ceilings."
0,The ambiance is cute but I probably won't come back.
0,Our food was delicious - bloodys were legit - and service was attentive and upbeat.

0,Really nice setting as well.
0,The foodFried eggs with cheddar polenta  breakfast sausage
0,lol  Only issue I had was the noticeably greasy whole wheat toast.
0,yelpcomuserlocalphotPoached eggs buttermilk biscuit and country gravy

0,Food is just as good if not better than other similar neighborhood places.
0,The interior is unexpectedly stylish and modern.
0,"What pisses me off more so is you see a lot of the staff just standing around bs'ing with each other.I hate writing such long review but i feel this story needs to be shared.In summary:The bad: service, quality of food (flavor and freshness), value for your moneyThe good: ambiance, location (which IMO are both a waste considering the above) and i must say, they have GREAT coffee!"
0,"I ordered the California Benedict, which was good but my friend ordered something from the lunch menu, which was really good (I can't remember what it was though)."
0,Its not really loud and has awesome outdoor lighting because of their glass windows
0,The eggs were cooked properly I just wish the hollandaise sauce was a bit more flavorful as I thought it was a little on the bland side
0,"Everything is pretty decent, the meatballs were mouthwatering."
0,Order the meatball for appetizer ravioli and steak for  the meal
0,"Eggs were poached to perfection, and adding avocado along with the roasted tomato just added a great mixture of flavors that went well together.My wife had the sugar dusted texas toast, and it was as good as it can be."
0,Wonderful dining experience and plan to go back very soon
0,The nutella along with the slightly sugary toast made for a very sweet and soft combination that'll wake up your taste buds.Good food for a good price; would definitely recommend.
0,"Also, they're part of the rewards network on airline portals, so you can receive extra miles for your dining of $30 or more."
0,"We were seated right away, but grabbed the last spot in the house so otherwise we would've waited."
0,"The waitstaff is extremely friendly, and the place was busy enough that you felt like you were at a happening place without feeling claustrophobic.Sesame Street was being played on the projector, which is actually an amazing thing to watch when you're a few Bloody Mary's deep."
0,"Regardless, this is a great dish in terms of quality: the ingredients were quite fresh, the poached eggs oozed nicely onto the scampi, and the flavors mixed together well."
0,Upon arriving we were seated at a table for two right away
0,was delicious but did comment to waiter it was not cooked correctly
0,"pricepoint  not cheap but well worth it.I am sucker for service, they overcooked my lamb."

0,"we didn't even finish our food - and us girls can eat!however, from the other reviews that i've read, and the fact that i live a block away from this place, i will have to give it another chance."
0,If the portion was smaller it would serve as a great appetizer.
0,There are so many reviews here for brunch but their dinner menu was fantastic.
0,"i guess i'm a pretty picky eater, but seriously, the vegetables weren't fully cooked in our omelets!"
0,"The salmon was a p.e.r.f.e.c.tly cooked medium like we asked with a crackly crust, and my friend wouldn't share her ravioli because it was apparently that good."
0,"the ambiance of the place seemed very nice - especially during the evenings when i always saw people sitting outside.so anyway, i finally had a chance to go there."
0,However dont expect huge portions of pasta here

0,And we dont regret it
0,"However, their brunch is amazing, they have tons of great specials every weekend and the absolute best bloody mary around."
0,Not the hugest fan of Locale for dinner a little overrated and over priced
0,The ambiance of the inside was very comfortable looking as well so I think we would have been happy no matter where we sat.
0,For dinner I ordered the Crispy Gnocci which was DELICIOUS
0,"It was also such a great portion size, so I was able to finish it and still have room for dessert!"
0,An excellent value and always a lovely experience
0,I highly recommend trying this place if youre in the neighborhood looking for a casual dinner spot for a reasonable price
0,A bit of a disappointment after reading so many great things about Gastroteca.
0,"Came here one night for dinner, and the meal started off great with well crafted cocktails."
0,"I noticed some people were just having drinks...so maybe I would recommend this as a spot for a drink and a dessert, not necessarily dinner."
0,"The ""crispy"" gnocchi seemed more like an excuse to describe the pasta as ""overdone."""
0,"The crostini had good flavor combinations but again, read more like burnt toast."
0,"!...best sauce, very tender chicken, yummy skin (just a little)...awesome chicken dish and this is coming from a chicken-non lover."
0,My babes had the Organic Lemon Chicken and it was Divine!
0,"), next came the Rigatoni Bolognese, it was fine, perfectly Al Dente, but maybe I'm just not a Bolognese sauce lover, but it was better, way better than the risotto, please don't get the risotto."
0,"The Risotto is wayyy too salty and just wayy too herby or just wayy too much of something in there that didn't taste right...the waitress noticed I wasn't enjoying and asked me how it was fine and yea, I was truthful (why not!, I'm a yelper for pete's sake ;-0) and right away she offered another disk (big brownie points!!"
0,"The decor was nice, and the staff charming, but I don't think we will be returning for dinner."

0,their tri colore salad is the best i've ever had.
0,"they don't have an extensive menu, but i think you can definitely find something you'd like."
0,"overall, it has a nice bar/lounge/candlelight ambiance - i'm definitely one for moods when dining.the food i had was pretty good, although i guess the prices are a bit high for queens."
0,Its open modern decor exuded a bit of elegance mixed in with coziness which combined made you feel welcome
0,"We ended up sitting at the bar because we were short on time and it ended up being great because the bartender was super attentive and friendly, offering us coffee right away and refills constantlyWe started with the meatballs; they were super moist and just over all delicious."
0,Overall-If your looking for a nice Italian restaurant with a great bar attentive staff and good prices then this is place to go.
0,A fun brunch spot with a broad menu
0,Fluffy well cooked omelets crispy bacon and of course mimosas
0,"This review is solely on the service and not the food, as that was great.You would think that the service would be great, if not wonderful especially on a Sunday Afternoon, with no crowds and a call was placed in advance just incase we weren't able to get a seat, as it was a group of 6 people."
0,"Their sister restaurant is Lucas Steakhouse which is about a thousand times better, but in a totally different restaurant category so one can't really compare."
0,"Sorry Locale, I gave you many many chances, we were so excited to have moved to your neighborhood, but very sorely disappointed with the service and quality of food."
0,"Brunch is good, however I recommend Stove over Locale for brunch."
0,Our reservation was for 530pm and our group had arrived around 510pm
0,"the last time I went, I got duck something and the duck was rubbery and chewy (i've had duck before plenty of times, I know what it should taste like, so i'm not just making up stuff) and my boyfriend got some kind of sea bass which was on the specials and it was completely over salted and greasy.Not to mention, the food always takes a very very long time to come out--in fact this might be my biggest issue with Locale.The drinks are delicious."
0,"Thinking we would be able to sit down earlier than expected as we were a little early on time, but we were very wrong."
0,"Yeah, the menu is more creative than a lot of the other places in Astoria, but that's not enough to make the food really top quality--taste-wise...I've had most things on the menu and nothing stood out especially."
0,"Even after 2 individuals from the group approached the restaurant employee (on separate occasions) asking in regards to our table, both times we received an answer not suggesting that they would seat us."
0,About the foodits just OK I frankly dont understand what the hype is for
0,I don't think i'll be going here again.
0,"I am not sure what it was..maybe it was because we were a culturally different group of people or maybe because we had a child amongst us, but it wasn't until we noticed that other people were being seated other than us that we decided to go to another restaurant down the block."
0,In all honesty because of this experience I would probably never go back here or recommend this establishment to any friend or family member that I know
0,So why 4 stars
0, Check out below for my reviews of various aspects of our brunch ventureFOOD 45  It was hit or miss for my family but I enjoyed 34 dishes we had
0,I've never had any PARTICULARLY really GOOD version of anything there.
0,Drink specials are delicious.Go find out for yourself and enjoy!!!
0,There were some issues though
0,"The grits, sorry, polenta was so soft it could have been mistaken for a sauce."
0,Dont know the bartenders name but this gal makes a mean Bloody Mary
0,The mimosas/bellinis/bloody Marys are not included and are rather pricey in terms of drink per dollar.
0,And there was maybe one or two very thin slices of chicken breast on the bottom.
0,"My mom got the vegetarian benedict, while my brother got the lamb hash benedict and both thought each one was really yummy."
0,The southwestern omelet with jalapeno relish was quite good.
0,"I got the brunch lasagna, which was also delicious, but the bottom lasagna layer was very tough... Not sure why, but the inside was the important part and who's complaining with losing a layer of carbs?"
0,The salad that came on the side was SUPER SALTY.
0,There is nothing local about this place and if you want maple syrup bring your own because you will get Aunt Jemima and a dumb look.
0,it was so salty my tongue was all shriveled up I wasn't sure if I could continue on.
0,Or for that fact stay home and cook yourself breakfast and understand that what you just made is comparably bad to the food at Locale.
0,Price expensive comparing to other restaurants like this
0,Thank you Gastroteca and waiter for making me enjoy such a wonderful brunch meal with my love.
0,Im really grateful that a delicious and classy brunch place like this is open on weekdays as well
0,Depending on your taste the salumi was super flavorful while the red pepper was a delight and hearty.Lastly ordered the rigatoni carbonara!
0,Dont trust him either
0,Love the guanciale and the pasta noodles were so fresh you could taste it!
0,Some hack carrying himself as either an owner or manager said he would comp the craptastic waffles and then sent us a round of mimosas.
0,Keep in mind the waitress recommended the burrito therefore I recommend the opposite of what the wait staff recommends
0, There was a fly in the restaurant
0,We were told we could sit anywhere.
0,Its a decent spot to meet some friends but certainly nothing to get excited about
0,It is very sparse.
0,Cant complain thereOverall a positive brunching experience
0,"A vaguely classical Greece/Rome motif adorns the walls, but overall, it's what you would expect from restaurant brunch, and non diner/Denny's brunch.The staff was friendly, and helpful."
0,"It feels like an upscale-ish sort of place, big glass windows, a separate eating area with more coffee-shop style cushions and low tables."
0,There was supposed to be a garlic aioli on the sandwich but there was barely any
0,We made a reservation for 730 on a Sunday night although when we got there we probably wouldnt have even needed it
0,I ordered Pineapple Mojitolittle too light for my taste but ok and their special Lamb Chop This was amazing
0,The place was pretty empty so we were given a choice between indoor seating or outdoor seating - we chose inside.
0,The tables are ridiculously small for the amount of things they want to put on them.
0,"the lamb was falling off the bone, and the portions were beyond generous."
0,You would think they would have wine stands by now since they fancy themselves as a more sophisticated restaurant.
0,Recently they have added glass bowls the size of a small goldfish bowl to house one lone floating rose (not a great use of space to say the least).
0,Hmm  perhaps
0,"I'm sure they'll work out their problems in time (well, let's hope!)."
0,"The ambiance is wonderful once you get past the cramped quarters and the food is ok, not great."
0,Its really lovely to have a drink or a meal at Locale as long as you ignore its shortcomings
0,Dont break your back trying to have dinner in the lounge
0,It's downfalls are that it's overpriced (especially for the disappointingly small portion sizes) and the strained service (they seem understaffed).
0,"I will only return for a glass of wine at the bar, will never spend another dime on that over showcased, overpriced food."
0,The seats are great for having a cocktail but deadly when trying to have a meal.
0,"The better choice for this place is going for drinks not dinner... we went to locale this past weekend and was totally disappointed, after been a repeat customers, we've tried a lot from the long list of specials and had much better food before, service as always..great!!"
0,"the entrees were mediocre and very over priced (you pay for ambience, nice space) and the bartender (male) was somewhat snobby and unwilling to socialize."
0,"The difference was execution;  it was bland, the colors ran to the point that it looked like it was shaken to toss, and the worst part was the goat cheese pad was obviously microwaved in saran wrap (everyone knows the smell and how it dries out cheese) and not toasted."
0,Our server Ryan was perfect with every nuance.
0,Parking can be tough but if your in walking distance I would definately stop in.
0,so i'd probably return for drink and then eat elsewhere...
0,The decor is very cute like the white brick wall and a Lady and the Tramp drawing by the full stocked bar.
0,Seriously how do you mess up on poached eggs but the second time was perfection as the delicious yoke flows out onto the platethats what I am talking about
0,No melted chocolate inside
0,OMG my dish was superbly del-ic-iousssssss you know.
0,If you order a bottle of wine and bottle of water prepare to balance your main course on your nose
0,everyone who worked there was incredibly polite and helpful.
0,The waitress told us that it would take 10 minutes since it was made to order.
0,Avoid the waiter with the woverine sideburns at all costs
0,"For some reason the wait staff didnt seem to see us, even though we sat right next to the entrance door."
0,"I'd give this place 5 stars, but you seriously can't enjoy it with a party of 3 or more people!"
0,"Waiter was very helpful and talkative, made the experience even better."
0,"Had the duck special with some stuffing that contained cranberries, was pretty good."
0,Same interesting crowd of somewhat people mostly 30 and up
0,Still has the cramped feel definitely would not recommend for large parties unless you dont mind being on top of each other great place for couples
0,Love the artwork inside too
0,It's too bad I live so far away now.
0,I'd definetely have to say that I've had better.
0,"If you've dined in the city, you will realize that the food, service, and atmosphere is mediocre."
0,"Brunch has all your standard offerings plus some pretty amazing paninis, but dinner is the real winner."
0,The server was such a sweet girl!
0,A breath of fresh air
0,"So, we opted to order our drinks with our server because the bartenders were SO RUDE."
0,Clearly putting away glasses doesnt need to be done before helping a customer
0,"Or ""Hey, just give us a minute were busy."""
0,"I know restaurants/bars get busy, but one of them could have said, ""Hi, I'll be right with you."""
0,We were seated in a corner by the window and could barely make it by all the other people without disturbing them
0,Overall the place is trendy but they want to charge Manhattan prices for a place in Queens.
0,Beautiful and impressive interior  on this ever changing avenue...The sidewalk in the summertime has a tendency of being packed and there is usually a waiting list...it can be quite a scene ( but not in the obnoxious 30th avenue type of the way - all you Astorians know what I mean).The food is delicious and the pineapple mojitos are a must...don't have too many...the morning after is a b$%@h. For the most part the service appears to be attentive but is really quite a mess.
0,They try to give the illusion that they care but for the most part they could be bothered.
0,It actually took them 20 minutes!....and when it finally arrived it was completely dry!
0,I couldn't tell the difference from grits and polenta unless its the same thing but mmmmmmmm love the shrimps and sausage combination and there was definitely some heat from the peppers and tomato sauce!
0,The atmosphere was nice and low key- We happend to go and they were playing Back to the future on the projector screen lol which made my day.
0,"We ordered the following:Italian fried chicken & buttermilk waffle - my first time having ""chicken and waffles"" combo and thought it was pretty good."
0,"The music and atmosphere are really great, super chic, and a lot more original than most places in the neighborhood."
0,Could have used a bit more pear as the slice of bread was sizable but overall the crunch of the crostini was a nice surprise as at first it didn't look toasted.
0,"The servers are all so friendly, knowledgeable, and can actually be really funny."
0,The ambience is just right to savor your dish and the company youre with
0,Flavored Martinis sweeten things up
0,"The waiter was terrific from the moment we sat till we left, just outstanding."
0,I couldn't decide what to order because everything on the menu sounded amazing.
0,Went with the brunch lasagna and WOW
0,If youre around for dinner the fish entrees are always spot on and the steaks are perfectly done
0,Brunch meal cost with tip for 2  less than 40
0,California benedict also tasty but bread was difficult to cut through (too spongy).
0,They have really good deserts too.
0,"If you are going to get anything from the daily specials you might want to ask the price, otherwise you might end up with a $40 steak, but it was well worth it in my case."
0,Note they only have whole milk when ordering lattes which deterred me from ordering one but my brother got a mocha latte and enjoyed it.The spinach and goat cheese omelette was pretty good.
0,"My brother said that his dish, the smoked salmon crostino, was spicy and ok. Not sure he would get it again but he agreed that the bread and home fries were great and he would come again to try something new."
0,There are a lot of restaurants in Astoria but only few on 34th Avenue
0,(very strong lol)We ordered the fried calamari and you get a good portion for your money.
0,Also the place had 3 full tables when we got there because it was so early and we waited 30 minutes for our apps.
0,My fiancée meal was a good portion as well with a good blend of taste.
0,The crab cake is really good but way too pricey for what you get.
0,"Their basil pesto and the garlic flavor is exceptional and don't forget to try it with the mash potato in the middle :) Literally, the most uninspiring meal of my life."
0,"At night, it's got a pretty sexy feel, so if you're aiming to impress, this needs to be your new date place."
0,"If you haven't checked this place out, you should definitely give it a try."
0,I literally wanted to lick my plate as it was just heavenly amazing yummers Definitely a great spot for Sunday Brunch
0,I'll probably be there sipping one of their Specialty Cocktails with my girlfriends!
0,"The waitress was really nice, and she apologized and asked if I wanted to change it for something else, but I didn't."
0,"The calamari was chewy, and not crispy, so I returned."
0,"The Event Coordinator, Jordan, and GM were so patient and helpful as we planned every detail."
0,"Jordan met with us twice to confirm the layout, menu and special touches (nudge,nudge: they can project  movies or slideshows that match your event)."
0,The servers were super attentive to us and our guests.
0,One of the gems along with Brick Cafe and Cafe Mundo of the venturing beyond 30th Ave and Broadway
0,More for the scene than serious gourmet
0,If you want to hang out for drinks in the evening fine but dinner elsewhere is a much better idea
0,Overall had a lovely and relaxed time
0,I would highly recommend Gastroteca for a private event oe dinner.
0,"I had the ""Texas toast"" which is deep fried French toast stuffed with Nutela and my accomplice had the goat cheese omelet with a side of red-pepper home fries which I recall he described as being ""bomb-dizzle."""
0,"The modern atmosphere is pretty sweet and although the portions are tiny, their breakfast options are exquisite."
0,nice little place...definetly a pleasant addition to an otherwise quiet strip on 34th avenue.....food is ok......its a great place to go in the summer with the outdoor seating....and also a great place to go mon-fri as its pretty quiet and you can relax there at night.overall been there a few times and had a good experience.
0,"While this place is truly lovely in decor and its vibe, the food was mediocre at best."
0,I must agree with the general consensus.
0,I would go there again but avoid the blonde waitress with the possibly fake European accent.
0,"BUT I ordered the gnocchi for brunch and it was $16, no problem at all, but when it came, it was so small compared to the other plates my family ordered, and it was the most expensive out of all of them."
0,The waitress was a total ditz and the service wasn't awesome but the hostess/bartender was super cool.
0,Their menu was decent - nothing too crazy.
0,I got the grilled vegetable panini grilled eggplant pepper and goat cheese it was delicious
0,Went there for brunch today
0,"Besides the polenta mixup, I believe the food was notable overall.SERVICE - Terrible."
0,"The issue wasn't with what happened, but rather what did not happen.First off, I never felt or server was pleasant."
0,I usually go for brunch and love the menu even though its a la carte
0,It was pretty unpleasant.
0,Their pasta dishes are very generous - the fagottini dish is a personal favorite.
0,Locale has a unique (without being pretentious) menu.
0,I've taken a number of different friends over the last year and the reviews are all great.
0,HOWEVER BIG NOTE TO THE MANAGER SERVE WHAT YOU ADVERTISE ON THE MENUI dont know about everybody else but if you advertise the salmon with Broccolini dont give me sautéed spinach
0,Also how fancy
0,Funny--that arugula looked a whole lot like regular romaine lettuce.
0,The service was so slow (we probably had three or four different servers throughout the meal and still didnt have great service!)
0,Perfect for one of those lazy summer nights when you just want to eat and get trashed with your loved one
0,They've got great mixed drinks and the sangria is serious.
0,Take pride in your word
0,"While the service was great and the ambiance warm and inviting, the food lacked flavor!"
0,All three dishes were bland and flavorless
0,I'll start with the cons - best to be upfront about these things.
0,Whenever I order gnocchi I get this enormous portion that ends up just making me sick because I can't stop eating it.
0,Just the right portions too
0,Improvement point to the staff add some other hot sauce options besides tabasco
0,except you had to bend over your food a bit
0,"horrible service, rude hostess, i called two hours ahead to make sure brunch is available before 4pm."
0,Quality dining at this gastroteca
0,"Everything was good, from soup to nuts.We started with oysters and tuna crudo, a very tasty prelude to the main events."
0,"Competently mixed drinks were flowing.For me the standouts were creamy polenta, veal meatballs, balsamic glazed lamb ribs, and the arancini (mushroom, truffle, and stracchino)."
0,The zeppoles came with a little chocolate dip on the side but that didn't even help give some flavor.
0,"However, when I cut into the first one.....the inside was completely raw."
0,Good food with friendly serviceeverything you expect from a great NY restaurant
0,"So even though everything tasted good, I felt like the portion size was not enough to fill me up..."
0,Next time I'll sit there and get wine poured by the cute guy.
0,"She was happy with the taste of her dish, however the portions were too small for her liking."
0,Waitress (two) were very attentive and never let our cups go dry.
0,"I normally don't order chicken at restaurants b/c it can be bland, but the salt and flavor was just right."
0,Plenty of water and wine
0,I ordered the branzino and swapped the sauce/pancetta for garlic mashed potatoes.
0,Cool place to go and meet friends
0,It came on a bed of arugula and this delicious white sauce
0,The artichokes were lightly friend and still juicy on the inside.
0,"Half of the restaurant is outdoor seating and even if you sit indoors, the ceilings are really high and the glass doors next to the area are always open, giving the entire restaurant a nice airy feel."
0,Perfect for enjoying the breezy sunny spring mornings
0,I know some people who go to Brunch to have an excuse for drinking before 3pm but the food here was really good!
0,I got a chicken&waffles and my friend got a charles benedict - totally iconic brunch staples that Gastroteca did well on.
0,"I would have liked better customer service since it we pretty much seated ourselves and didn't get addressed until 15 minutes later, but ultimately the decor, customer service, environment comes second to the food - which was spot on."
0,"They have a decent spin on a classic chicken Caesar salad, but the chicken was so scarce."
0,Keep it up
0,"The steak special is to die for, artichoke ravioli is fantastic, a blueberry martini was superb."
0,Great atmosphere nice outdoor seating off the main strip so its not too crowded fresh and delicious food reasonably priced and our waiter loved our dogs and even had treats for them
0,The food is amazing and the portions are the perfect size not too small and foofy and not so abundant where it is wasteful
0,"I have gone there many times for many different occasions ... casual Sunday brunch, dinner dates, Saturday night cocktails, and the atmosphere is flexible for all."
0,"However, this place was really pricey especially for the portion size."
0,Wow.There was way more food than I could eat without bursting at the seams.
0,"I had the fried oyster sandwich that was cooked perfectly, albeit it was the size of my face and I could barely get through it."
0,"I would like to think that I'm very down to Earth, and try to be as forgiving as possible."
0,The crispy gnocchi lamb ribs gorgonzola pear salad cacio e pepe etc
0,"Also can't forget to mention the fantastic service!I do wish they'd bring back the bone marrow and that brunch had more consistency, but overall I would recommend this spot to everyone!"
0,I came mid afternoon on a Monday so business was practically non existent and the service was therefore slow.
0,I overlooked this factor since the server was nice and I've been in the industry for a long time so I understand how it is.
0,"Having said that, the one thing I cannot get over is the fact that various members of the staff including management openly commented about the bad tip that the recently vacated table had just left."
0,"Since I was the only guest left in the restaurant, I could clearly hear every word."
0,I'm willing to give this establishment a few more chances on different days and times but I'll never forget this first awkward experience...
0,For dessert I ordered the Nutella bread pudding yum and boyfriend got the cheese board which was definitely enough for two people
0,I can only review my experience visiting this spot one time on a Thurs night.
0,I ordered the tagliata (steak) and it wasn't good.
0,A poor cut of meat tough with gristle
0,It's always touchy to send something back and it would've kept me in the restaurant longer than I wanted.
0,My view is that steak should never have gotten to the table in the first place.
0,Waste of money
0,"It's ok.Probably not to go back to though.Besides always being over booked for since there isn't many decent breakfast and brunch spots in Astoria anymore, the food is just not great.It's just ok.We ordered the classic eggs Benedict, the hollandaise sauce was pretty good but everything other than that was blah.The muffin on the bottom was black burned and you could very much taste it, the ham on top was pretty cheap ham that you could get in a deli."
0,"I literally tried 5 of them and gave up, they were completely raw potatoes with only outside done."
0,So not eatable
0,Loved the music playing 50s60s music kept me singing softly at our table
0,"We also ordered a latte, they did a decent job with it since they don't have a coffee machine to make a real one.And we also ordered the Nutella stuffed French toast, which was pretty good."
0,"It would be great if they served it with some berries to contrast the heaviness of all that sugar, dough and Nutella.Cute, but not great, probably not coming back."
0,"Unfortunately this isn't on the online menu, so I can't relay the exact ingredients."
0,"I only had one bite, but the uncommon béchamel as a substitute for lasagna's red sauce was memorable."
0,My absolute fave is the blue crab spaghetti.
0,I started with beef tartare which came with some delicious spicy mustard and got a fruit tart for dessert
0,5 stars all the way
0,If spicy is how you like your Bloody Marys then they have the one
0,"All I can say is, gorganzola filet mignon special."
0,Will definitely go back for another review on their main dishesFood We had 3 different crostinis I enjoyed the one with the honey and truffles the most
0,"The Veal meatballs were not the best, maybe my taste preference is more towards a softer meatball but theirs were tough and not a ton of flavor to them either.Drinks: Had happy hour white wineSetting: Located on the corner of a quiet street in Astoria."
0,"It is a very nicely done restaurantService: Adequate, the waitress came a few times and was courteous."
0,"I could go on and on about each dish I've eaten there, but alas, I'll spare you the details."
0,I don't think I have ever had a bad meal or drink here (although the red sangria was a bit too strong/brandy tasting).
0,because they are just incredible (the blood orange martini and the mojito are both amazing).
0,I'd suggest starting out with a cocktail (or two!)
0,The zeppoles/donuts are a MUST- they're to die for.
0,"I must say, as a resident of Astoria, Locale is the greatest restaurant I've tried."
0,I can't wait to go back in summer to sit outside and try the margaritas that a friend has always recommended to me.
0,It's pretty small but we had a seat by the window so didn't have to sit in tables right next to each other.
0,The restaurant itself is very cute and definitely highlighted for me how young Astoria as a neighborhood really is (or is getting).
0,Super cute date spot great ambiance love the decor with your SO or your gfs
0,That was a bummer but it did seem like the steak would have been delicious if it were actually rare.
0,"The one downside, food-wise, was my boyfriend's steak wasn't rare at all despite ordering it medium rare and them apparently being kind of a ""steak place."""
0,Both very delicious and the outdoor seating made it that much more enjoyable
0,The coffee at the end was a HUGE cup for the end of the night but I wasn't complaining.
0,But the Zeppoles were AHHHH-mazing.
0,Shoulda done outdoor seating but maybe next time.
0,That place is perfect for starting your day off.
0,I felt like the bill came out a little too high considering it's a neighborhood restaurant in Astoria.
0,Also love the spacing and the serenity of the place
0,All I have to say wasWOWthat Chicken and Waffle was amazing and it was definitely the best Ive ever had
0,The vintage movies being projected on the white washed brick walls are an added charm to the place.
0,Bread to go with sauce was garlicky but i didn't like that one end of it was already dipped into the sauce plate because it got a little soggy.
0,I dont know why it came out after our appetizers were brought to us since it was cold bread anyway not like it was being newly prepared in the back
0,you have to be careful bc Ive either had amazing food here or terrible food
0,"Carbonara was good, but tasted a little like chicken bullion powder."
0,If you dont have a palate and want to eat whatever this is the place to go
0,At no point did this place ever  blow me away
0,"Wish places lumped em in brunch price like Fattys (even if they're not ""loaded"" with vodka or celery and such - it's just nice to go with the meal)."
0,"Glad I tried here finally and i would go back if someone wanted to go, but was happier at Fattys, flo and ovelia."
0,Pasta was cooked well
0,"The missus had the Benedict - again very good , but shy of something I would rave about and say you HAD to go and try."
0,"The gnocchi was dense and gluey, sauce was good for first few bites but since it was very creamy, i had trouble finishing portion even though it was not that big."
0,Came on a Monday evening at 5:30 so it was relatively quiet.
0,"Its open late, they don't pressure you, the waiters are great they know their wines and offer awesome suggestions.... Its a great place to have a drink or eat a delicious dinner."
0,"The restaurant has a great atmosphere, good crowd, good service and a unique take on the cuisine, I'll try it again sometime when my pocketbook can better take the hit."
0,Had our choice of sitting inside or out
0,"I can imagine that at a restaurant like this you really get what you pay for, and there are some chef's specialties like the Mozzarella Olivata which is homemade cheese served hot with olives and tomatoes."
0,"I had ordered the dish with a white sauce which was flavorful but thin, and didn't really stick to anything.Other times we've eaten at Locale the food was very good, and we tried tonight to keep the price down."
0,"The pasta itself wasn't anything special, and the sauce wasn't quite what I expected, as it was rather thin."
0,"It wasn't that 'lumpy' but didn't seem to be loaded with much bread either.I ordered the seafood pasta which was served with a whole assortment of seafood: scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari and crab."
0,"There was a saucer of marinara sauce for dipping, but it was too chunky and the zucchini strips too thin to make it easy to dip into and get good 'coverage'."
0,"The restaurant was crowded, though I'd say it is a little pricey for the neighborhood, but the cuisine is definitely above average.We ordered the fried zucchini as an appetizer."
0,My roommate got tomato soup for her appetizer and it was not good.
0,"The appetizers are the best, with the braised meatballs and the fried artichoke hearts being my favorites."
0,"It wasn't our final choice, but I was glad i was able to try out their brunch menu yesterday."
0,"If you're alone or don't want a big sit-down production, sit at the bar."
0,DECOR Pretty trendy
0,"The music was fun as well, but I some may not like it (I liked it a lot).OVERALL- Food was good, and I can't really complain."
0,"They also have a cute little couch/lounging area that is great for a small group of friends to chill out, have a drink and an appetizer together before starting the night."
0,There is outdoor seating a big selling point for me in the summer
0,Hopefully the service issue was a one time thing b/c I'm definitely interested in revisiting this joint.
0, Apologies for the lack of pictures
0,"Idk what happened to me, but I totally forgot to take them =/ When it's a holiday you should brunch the day away."
0,They should adjust their prices a bit because they are across from a bodega not in the middle of Chelsea.
0,#baked #lasagna #brunch #holiday #eggs #yolkporn #bacon #sausage #breakfast #idreamofqueens #pasta #wakeandbake #astoria #qtgm I'm so bad.
0,Only draw back is that there should be a perk for eating in Astoriayet the price is just like Manhattan
0,"Seeing very positive reviews for both brunch and dinner, I figured I'd check it out!"
0,They have a decent amount of options for brunch no boozy specials sorry so it was definitely hard to pick
0,"Also, the shrimp were cooked well.We also ordered the special: the Chicken and Waffles - they were crusted with a cornmeal coating and topped with a maple honey butter."
0,"I'll miss the wonderful brunches here, specifically the eggs benedict."
0,I would not dine here again.. i recently moved and while i don't regret moving i wish this restaurant/bar could have moved with me!
0,"Mark the bar tender is personable, friendly, and made us feel so relaxed."
0,"I can understand that it is upscale for the neighborhood, but I don't think it has anything that special, not for the price they charge."
0,Extensive selection of drinks from cocktails to wines to aperitifs
0,Its kind of like hanging out at a friends house
0,"If it's not busy, the waitstaff will join you at the bar."
0,The bartenders are cool and are willing to experiment on any drink combination that you care to dream up.
0,"The small restaurant is a few blocks off the subway line, tucked away in a residential part of Astoria."
0,"It's quickly become a neighborhood favorite I'd been to Locale before I even moved to the city, but this weekend was my first time back."
0,The first time we went my boyfriend had the fagottini alla barbabietole and he didnt shut up for a week about how amazing it was and now orders it every time we go
0,"The food was mediocre, as was our dessert - the sandwiches were skimpy on the inside with tons of bread on the outside, and the french toast bread pudding w/ nutella was tough and chewy... On the plus side, the waitress was friendly and good, and the coctails were tasty, especially the bourbon bloody mary."
0,"I'll take my parents here when they visit NYC.My reservations were happily greeted despite arriving a few minutes late.Talk about finding a golden egg, here's my experience.My date and I opened with Kale Caesar Salad."
0,The oils seasonings and cheese blending perfectly with white anchovie paste
0,"A dish to remember that prepared us for the entree.The entree was presented open faced to my date with thumb out of the plate- something you see at a 5 star restaurant.Again, the service and style was impeccable.Entrée being roasted rosemary chicken on a bed of potatoes mash surrounded by a lovely moat of gravy."
0,"Topped with a duo of de-skined roast plum tomatos.Each bite was worth every chew.If I had one request as a chicken going to slaughter, I would ask for this to be my fate.Desert was presented in the same method, respecting my girlfriend.A coconut panna cotta spired with a golf ball mango sorbet and pineapple chutney, sitting in a shallow layer of guava soup.If Gilligan and his crew had this coconut dish, the whole squad wouldn't have left the island.After our meal, Chef John the owner himself, came out to greet us and thank us for our patronage."
0,"Did they think we were critics from michilen, NY times...?This was a very special service that I will not forget."
0,"I think this place is still a hidden and quaint local spot in Astoria and hope that we can still drop by, with no reservations, on any given morning with the same greeting and amazing food/service."
0,"Unbelievably awesome in pretty much everyway.An unforgettable meal, excellent service, and adorable atmosphere."
0,"I really hope this place is as good on super busy nights.I was sad it was over, but happy that it happened."
0,I dont blame the servers who kept apologizing
0,Around the table were orders of pancakes and burgers
0,Woke up to have brunch this morning in a group of 8 with no reservations
0,The portions were way smaller than expected.
0,"My risotto was more watery than creamy, and the beans dominated the taste."
0,"The salmon was kind of bland, but the sauce and corn did spice it up a little."
0,A few people commented on the brunch Ive had the brunch once or twice and its definitely not as strong as their dinner menu but I dont think of Local as a brunch place so its not really considered in my 5 starer
0,Always a jaw dropping selection of specials great food friendly service reasonable prices given the quality and nice atmosphere
0,We  definitely left here hungry.
0,I recommend Cafe Bar down the street
0,This is not a problem if you do a select few dishes extremely well but thats not the case at Locale
0,Lazy at bestTheres little variety on the menu
0,The eggs Benedict was served with a softboiled rather than poached egg
0,"In addition, they had a very excellent brunch cocktail menu."
0,"Although we had one waitress when our party was there, she was very attentive to everyone."
0,All and all I can't imagine the service to be that bad on a daily basis especially after lookin at at other reviews however very disappointing to say the least.
0,Our waitress was very enthusiastic and knowledgable of the menu.
0,"""Dinner is a different story though."
0,I'll admit the brunch can be hit or miss.
0,Maybe next time I'll just stick to a drink at the bar... or not.
0,I order the Italian  Benedict the hollandaise sauce  was exquisite and to top it all the banana Ricotta  Zeppole  are to die for.
0,Place is nice and airy but their brunch menu is so blend.
0,"service is attentive and speedy, especially if you opt for an early dinner."
0,"their salads are creatively delicious (yay, i said it)  and they've always got host of features."
0,first things first its super cute  sexy decor an impressive bar and a nice raised loungeyarea
0,"Gastroteca is a very airy gem in the residential areas of Long Island City, perhaps bordering on Astoria?"
0,"While the salmon was fresh, the egg perfectly half runny, crostino toasted to excellence, I still prefer the classic on English muffins."
0,This place is the best in the neighborhood (south astoria).We've been for both romantic dinner and casual late brunch with friends several times and have always enjoyed the food & service.
0,Drink it before the ice melts because it has the perfect consistency right when its prepared
0,"I would skip the former and dig in the latter, yum!"
0,It was honored no problem
0,"As Astoria begins to gentrify due to the onslaught of hipsters, ex-Wallstreet employees and the rest move out of the increasingly expensive city places like the trendy Locale being to pop up."
0,"Everyone is as pleasant as pie... and the wine list isn't that bad either... One additional thing i noticed about this place is that there's a huge mirror above the bar, tilted downwards, perfect for spying down your date's shirt."
0,If youre in the neighborhood and want a nice meal definitely stop by
0,Very sad to write this review but the service was TERRIBLE.
0,Ive been wowed a few times and safisfied the rest with my meal and the service
0,Thankfully the food was good so the wait for the next 25 minutes for our entrees was worth it.
0,The place has way too many tables and gets extremely full on certain nights!
0,I would of given it 5 stars this time around BUT the waitstaff seemed to be a bit bipolar...he started off super sweet and THEN i did the unthinkable and accidentally hit my glass (empty) and it fell to the floor and broke...he instantly turned into a prick and was very rude...ummm sucks for him that he flipped BEFORE i wrote his tip in!
0,"Now that I moved 15 minutes away, I never come here, so it can't be that amazing."
0,Great portions as well not huge but enough to satisfy
0,It was 750 there was a reservation for 8 pm
0,While we waited we looked over the menu trying to make the next big food decision.
0,"I had of the vegetarian pastas which one she would recommend, of course it was the one with the white truffle sauce."
0,She said it was really heavy and both my mom and I were looking for something on the healthier side.
0,"While I was torn between a pasta dish and the polenta dish, my mom suggested that I asked if they'll do a half order of each."
0,While they weren't able to do a half order of the polenta they were able to with the pasta!
0,The presentation of this was really cool.
0,It also wasn't over dressed which was nice.
0,I'm so happy we ordered this dish and a half size could truly be a meal within itself.
0,It was important that you had a bite of the pasta with the a walnut because the sharpness of the cheese with the nutty walnut flavor was outstanding.
0,"The beet was present but it wasn't a very strong flavor, just enough to give a little bit of sweetness."
0,This polenta was unlike any polenta I've ever had before.
0,My mom pointed out that all the polenta she has had is always very dense whereas this was really nice and light.
0,It was a chunky sauce and you could see the veggies but it had this great kick to it.
0,"Again, I was shocked at how busy it was so it was a little on the noisy side but we were still able to have a conversation at the table."
0,I figured I'd scope out Open Tables to see if there were any reservations available.
0,At this point my mom and I were really hungry (dad had to sit dinner out because of the sausage he had at the San Gerrano Fest!)
0,Talk about luck of the draw on picking a restaurant
0,We got there on time and found the place was completely empty - not a great sign for a Sunday brunch spot.
0,I was expecting much better based on reviews and we were pretty disappointed.
0,Also seafood was not fresh.
0,I live on the same block the place is cute but the food only sounds good it's never amazing.
0,Husband ordered the eggplant and burrata sandwhich which was tasty and bread was fresh.
0,Back to the friesdefinitely worth another trip to Astoria just for them
0,Definitely saw a few eyecandies mmm
0,They did let us know that they'd be ready to go in about 45 minutes and if we wanted to come back we could then.
0,Cus of some picky customer must have been my old Boss haha
0,Once we got there we had to wait a few minutes for a table to be cleared but the host seemed gracious enough that we came back after we explained our earlier visit.
0,Our server didn't get our order down until at least 10 minutes and then the wait for the food seemed somewhat endless.
0,"One piece of advice that may have pushed my review to four stars - because it's the little things that go a long way, to make up for the inconvenience of not being ready for us at our reservation time it would have been nice if the restaurant offered us a comp'd appetizer or side or just didn't charge us for the coffee."
0,Its a few bucks but its the best way to make sure you send someone out with a positive reason to come back
0,We will likely be back there for brunch - but we would have raved about how Astoria has more heart when it comes to brunch than NYC had we gotten that extra bit of service!
0,I only come here once a month but this month they have a new Chef that won't do special request they have a California eggs Benedict I can't eat bread so I request a California omelette I got a big NO!!
0,It's an interesting little space which gives the restaurant a very cozy feel.
0,Incredible food matched by impeccable service.
0,I'm usually indifferent on mussels but they were outstanding as well as the calamari.The ambiance was very intimate and romantic but our work group make it work.
0,I come here fairly regularly for brunch because the food is delicious.
0,"Instead of writing short ribs, you should change it to kibbles of short ribs, because there was no sign of any meat.I thought it was cute that they sprinkled a little blue cheese over the dish.Please rename this dish ""Risotto with short ribs drippings""The decor is nice, come here to drink and nibble on small plates."
0,Such a lil GemVery friendly and sexy atmosphere
0,A great place for a glass of wine and a cheese plate
0,Have been meaning to come here for a while and we showed up without a reservation on a Sunday at noon
0,"If we come back, we will definitely make a reservation as the bar can get quite cramped."
0,One of my favorite dinner spots whenever I dont feel like cooking
0,"I've had here : Grilled Swordfish, Pasta Bolognese and Black Angus steak.Grilled Swordfish tasted ok, didn't know what to expect or how it should taste since I've never had swordfish."
0,"It was served with some fried onions but overall found it a little salty.Pasta Bolognese was about what you would expect, I was kinda wasted for that so I don't remember too much."
0,"Black angus steak was delicious, came precut with fries and argula on the side."
0,There is outdoor seating if you'd like and the street is typically pretty quiet.
0,If you come here with a date expect to walk out with a 80100 bill before tip
0,What a great local spot!This is my second time coming in and I plan on coming back many more times.
0,"I would recommend the Nutella 'stuffed' Texas toast.The only down side is it seems they have a small kitchen and staff, it was a little bit of a wait to get out food and the restaurant wasn't even half full."
0,Plus cant beat the yelp 10 discount
0,I have been here a few times now for brunch and lunch and each time Ive had delicious food great drinks and solid service
0,Very disappointing.Short Ribs with risotto - this was a bigger joke.
0,They can be serving any white fish and you wouldn't know!
0,"We Been before but Monique (maybe is spelled differently ) she was ..is great fast service really nice we love her :) First impression walking in the door was ""WOW""."
0,Try the espresso gelato
0,"The one thing I can't vouch for is the drinks/dinner/evening atmosphere because I've never been, but I would certainly be surprised if it was a letdown."
0,Everything was excellent (crispy gnocchi-crispy shrims-veal meatballs-risotto lamb sausage)service perfect.5 stars from me.nice job!!
0,"Everyone who works here is incredibly friendly and this place is completely free of that Brooklyn or Manhattan ""we are too cool"" pretentiousness."
0,"Apparently they do brunch too, but I have not experienced that (yet).FOOD: Our server recommended the Gorgonzola-stuffed pasta dish, and we were not disappointed."
0,Delicious super filling and paired with a great almost magenta colored
0,"The braised meatballs appetizer was delish as well, and I'll definitely be back to try their fish and steak entrees."
0,"It is GOOD.WINE: We were allowed to try the Cab Sauv (Snap Dragon) available by the glass, and to be honest, it was quite dull."
0,A LOT of places mark up their pasta dishes which is pretty silly when you think about how much the actual ingredients cost
0,"We opted for the more expensive Geyser Peak Cab Sauv ($45) and it was much, much better."
0,Definitely worth the difference in price
0,"If you're only up for a glass or two though, then you should probably opt for a different red, or perhaps a white.SERVICE: Pretty great service."
0,"Our entrees were kind of rushed out to us after the appetizer, and we ended up sticking around for a while in order to finish off the bottle."
0,"They also didn't charge us full price on the one scoop of Gelato that we wanted, which was noticed and appreciated.PRICE: Standard for a more upscale type restaurant, but I feel like their pasta dishes are slightly overpriced."
0,This isn't unique to Locale though.
0,The home fries didn't have a nice presentation to his dish and it was a bit stale.The drinks portion: I orderd a mango mimosa and he ordered a freddy kreuger ( spicier version of the bloody mary) Both drinks were good.Ambiance: It is a modern and pretty place with an full bar in front.
0,My boyfriend ordered the Portobello Benedict infused with truffle oil.
0,One thing happens when I eat something amazing is that I eat slowly wishing that it will never end.
0,"Why have just plain toast, when you can have nutella in it."
0,with a signature dish
0,A dish that really makes you say oh man I just got a hankering for the ABC dish at XYZ establishment
0,"The menu is pretty lackluster; you're standards like veal scallopine, seared salmon, a few pasta dishes, etc."
0,"Plus, the last drink my girlfriend has there, a mojito, tasted like someone dropped a shot of dish washing soap in it...Unless someone is treating me here, don't know if I'll actively try to come back any time soon."
0,Easily accessible via NQ trains lots of street parking nearby
0,"Staff is attentive but the kitchen is slooooow.Every item on the menu was ordered - nobody complained, but there wasn't a wave of silence when the food came either."
0,The starters were not good.
0,The sprout salad wasn't good either.
0,"The bartender and staff addressed us patiently as we changed our minds a dozen times before finally deciding - hey, we can order it all instead of trying to decide what dish to eat!And so we started off with Bloody Mary-s, and for me, a mango Mojito."
0,Totally worth feeling like a fatass.
0,"As for everything else, after my meal I couldn't fit to taste, but the plates were eaten clean and by the look of the satisfied smiles all around, this place is a solid 5 I'd say."
0,I would have to give it lower reviews because the chicken club sandwich I ordered was not good at all.
0,the bread was dry and burned and it was sliced chicken like in deli ham.
0,I need to go back and try another meal before I can give it a better review.
0,"Was there a couple of weeks ago, service is fast and food is good!"
0,I'd say ever so slightly above average actually.
0,"And while the service started strong, it quickly reverted to Locale's old reliable ineptitude (I was hoping that would not be inherited in the turnover) as I was left without a beverage throughout the majority of my entree (promised hot water for tea never came and my empty water glass never filled.)"
0,"The California Benedict is a joke -- ""avocado"" promised on the menu is a couple dollops of guacamole and you could hardly make out the roasted tomato at all under the poached egg."
0,The back corner is on a bit of a platform which makes for an interesting view if youre seated there
0,PS we ended up going to Brick Cafe where their service and food was spectacular!
0,enjoy
0,Locale is located in a quiet part of Astoria well a block away from bustling Broadway
0,"Since it is a small space, the tables are kind of close together and it gets loud so do not expect to have quiet conversations."
0,What is that amazing slightly crisp/buttery topping they put on top of the French Toast?
0,"After coming here for a brunch though, I have to say the physical space and decor were the best thing about it.One of the most attractive things about this place is the ambiance."
0,"The sides were also standard--nothing too exciting.This place is a fine place for standard brunch, but I don't know that I would return her for anything specific."
0,"It's not crowded either, so if you live in the 'hood it might do you well to come here instead of heading into the city for your benedict."
0,The area has so many other restaurants that I'd rather try what others have to offer before coming here again.
0,The desserts are delicious too (the boyfriend prefers the chocolate cake while I'm partial to the brownie).
0,"As I was trying to pick between orange juice and tea, the cheery waitress suggested an orange-flavored tea."
0,Going here for brunch is much more pleasant than trying to do the same in Manhattan.
0,"The portobella benedict was good, though I would have like more portabella on my benedict, and more home fries on the side (definitely stingy there)."
0,"I like the diversity of the menu, which includes brunch staples as well as more unique additions."
0,Nice outdoor seating' Went here last Sunday with two friends because we were able to make a reservation and I know how crazy brunch can get in Astoria.
0,"I should bring up that even though no cheese is listed on the menu, there was cheese melted onto every slice of bread."
0,"I can't eat dairy, so that was an immediate issue for me."
0,My guy friends ordered the recommended breakfast burrito - said it was mostly cheese and rice.
0,We look forward to coming here all the time and are very excited to try more new dishes on their fall menu!
0,I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Astoriaalthough we try new places from time to time we always say Gastroteca is better and that we wish we had gone there instead
0,"This is my third time there.Reasons to disregard my review:1) It was brunch at noon on a Sunday, so it was crowded2) There were two large parties of about 8 (with children) there when we arrived3) I was with a group of 64) I am generally a cranky personBut here's my experience.The good:-The ambiance is great."
0,Great size great light corner restaurant option for a more secluded area with couches
0,- The server was very nice- Decent coffeeThe not-so-good:The food was terrible.
0,It took 35 minutes forgiven you were busy and had two huge parties ahead of us and when it arrived 2 of our entrees were cold
0,Youre called Locale
0,Not only was the wine great (and at 5 dollars a glass for happy hour very affordable) but their homemade pastas were out of this world.
0,"If you take 35 minutes to bring food and it's cold, you should comp it."
0,If you charge that much for waffles and bring fake syrup at least warn me that Im about to get something gross
0,I'll probably go back - that's how much I want to like this place.
0,"The food was good; the pork chops with green vegetables I ordered was savory; however, the desserts (mixed berry bread pudding and banana/caramel napolean) were mediocre."
0,"The cost of food was more than I would have liked to have pay for a meal, but its OK to treat yourself every now and again :) Oh, the staff was very friendly."
0,"It was a bit of a troop to get there since its difficult to find parking, but it was worth it.Service: We missed our reservation by 10 minutes, but we got lucky that it was a snowy day and people were too lazy to come out."
0,"I got the spaghetti stracchino and she got the pappardelle verde (white bolognese sauce), which was a special at the time but it was so popular the restaurant put it on their new fall menu."
0,A few months ago I moved to Astoria and my girlfriend and I came for a drink because it looked really cute and intimate.
0,The waitress was more than kind and brought back a cheese-less sandwich very quickly.
0,It didn't take long food to arrive and everybody were happy with their meal.
0,"The aioli was really just mayo, the avocado was under ripe and even the prosciutto didn't taste like much.The atmosphere and service are pretty great, though those are really the only high points of my experience at Locale."
0,We got the Balsamic Glazed Lamb Ribs and the Tagliatelle Aragosta with lobster.
0,My verdict GO
0,Good food nice portion size amazing wait staff
0,I believe that whenever you celebrate any event it is never great unless you recieve a great service.
0,"Our server Allyson was the BEST, absolute sweetheart!"
0,"The only thing, I wish steak could have a little more char grill taste to it."
0,Normally I don't write reviews on Yelp but this place is so great I had to!
0,My friend had the eggs Benedict which he reviewed as very delicious also
0,I was surprised that the crowd was quite thin on a Saturday at 1130 am-but that just means more brunch for me!
0,"The menu is brilliant, but when the food comes out, it's just ok."
0,"It's probably a place better suited for couples and friends, although you could bring well behaved kids here."
0,"I will say that it was a special occasion, my birthday, and I don't feel like they made any kind of big deal about that (like Martha's Bakery on Ditmars did ) I thought hey, maybe a free OJ on the house or something."
0,The portions were small but in a way that didn't make you feel super full on the way out.
0,not from our waitress but from the owner himself
0,"While that was not great, it wasn't our main concern."
0,"So she talked to the manager, who came by and said the dish was ""100% Gluten Free"", but I had to be sure, so I explained to him about the deep fryer situation, and he seemed enlightened and said he would be back."
0,How do you overpower lamb flavor with sauce
0,"Though again I'd be hard pressed to explain how the preparation of three appetizers could possibly require the better part of an hour, especially when the establishment is nowhere near full capacity, this element of our experience alone isn't what prompted this negative review."
0,I will also note that we were the only minorities at the establishment--make of that what you will.
0,Those long-awaited appetizers were mediocre.
0,Real milk hot chocolate
0,My friends are both designers and so their approval is hard to come by.
0,"I have walked past it several times and have always been tempted to eat there, but since dieting lately, I didn't think I could do it healthfully, and boy was I wrong."
0,Jen and my roommate also both had sangria
0,"I was really happy with the soup in terms of tomato flavor, but was disappointed in the broth to ingredient ratio."
0,Really earthy tasting with the arugula and portabello combination.
0,"The bill was under $100 for 3 of us, which for a restaurant of this quality, in service and in food, is fairly reasonable."
0,Lived a few blocks away from here for a good few years and always overlooked it.
0,Service definitely exceeds what I normally expect in Astoria which is a big surprise so please please keep up the good work guys
0,stopped in Locale on a Saturday at 930 and was able to sit down without a reservation
0,There was a small party of about 12 next to us that had a few very loud guests but whatever they eventually left.
0,"place is nice looking, exposed brick and iron feel with tin ceilings and antiquely wall coverings."
0,"After waiting forty-five minutes for these orders and the Coke, my fiancé finally went into the restaurant to inquire, and was told the drink would be coming out shortly, and the appetizers in another ten minutes at most."
0,"(Oddly enough, the two glasses of wine we ordered at around the same time appeared a mere five minutes after placing the initial order."
0,"My fiancé, his family and I stopped by this evening for dinner as it was one of the few local restaurants open on July 4th and seemed to have a charming ambiance."
0,It was our goto brunch spot when my boyfriend lived nearby it had just the perfect atmosphere whether you were vaguely hungover or perky and ready to tackle the day
0,The staff was apologetic because 'the restaurant was so swamped on a Saturday night'.
0,I shouldn't have to suffer at a restaurant because there are other people eating there.
0,This place is expensive enough and should have their act together.
0,My biggest regret was not calling earlier to make a reservation at Trattoria Vesta which blows this place out of the water on all accounts
0,And also for a french place they should have MUCH better coffee.
0,SmallCrowd goodService niceDesign and aDelicious brunch outdoors with mango drinks
0,They really know how to make good flawless food
0,Prejudice or ineptitude
0,"The seating is a bit weird (big deep benches in some areas) so for short people like me it can be a bit awkward, but the food is so tasty I don't really care."
0,Also their mimosa selection is nice.
0,Oh and their cheese polenta  order it
0,"But still, it's one of the cooler, more hip spots in the area (especially during the summer) and the food is great.During the warmer months they take down the walls and completely open up the front, which is a nice touch."
0,"Both brunch and dinner are excellent, but I prefer brunch."
0,"There's no beer on tap, which is a bummer, but you can't go wrong with icy cold tap water.Note: restaurant.com offers discounted dinner gift certificates but they do not work!"
0,fairly simple dish but very tasty
0,generous portion also more than enough to split for an app
0,overall a very pleasant dinner.
0,"So I then chose my six items, to which the manager replied two of the six items were not available."
0,"She makes up for this place!Lentil soup was good but our main courses were average, too heavy on sauce and nothing spectacular about it."
0,"I'll give it another try, maybe the chef was just not in a good mood that night."
0,I attempted to make a reservation 3 times before it was acutally completed
0,"They said yes, but they didn't know what it was and they would get back to me."
0,"I was finally instructed by the manager that I should pick six items off the current menu, anything except the skirt steak and we would recieve unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, coffee, and tea for $40."
0,"I thought that was a little high so I asked if we could get 4 options with unlimited drinks for $35 - no, couldn't do it."
0,Why say pick any six if you didnt mean it
0,We'll be going back this weekend to enjoy another feast with our friends visiting from out of town.Thanks Locale!
0,"Then I asked for savory vegatarian options, the manager replied with two meat filled choices - come on."
0,Fast forward to the morning of - I called around 11 am letting them know that we would only have 10 instead of the intended 15 for our 1:30 reservation.
0,5 minutes later my phone rings with the manager asking me if I was cancelling the reservation
0,"I said no I'm not cancelling, I'm letting you know that we will not be as many as originally thought."
0,He told me that I couldn't do that in the future but this time he would let it slide.
0,At no point was I informed that they needed 72 hours notice on adjusting the reservation
0,Vey nice décor and great staff
0,We ended up closing the restaurant portion down as we enjoyed our delicious Sirah and none of the staff bothered to rush us out but let us enjoy our time thereHIGHLY RECOMMENDED and they are even starting a movie night on Tuesdays with halfpriced bottles of wine
0,"one pasta, one veal, one chicken and 4 glasses of wine was $95 i dont know that there is much more on the menu i would run back for, i didnt really see any other entrees that i was interested in."
0,"While we were there the food looked amazing, but the communication between the staff was terrible, after a few mistakes and hearing the couple stand up and say, ""After 30-minutes of waiting and they didn't once tell us it's cash only"", we departed.As we left, we bumped into that same couple and they said that they were going to Locale a few blocks away since they were set on Italian."
0,there was a duck special that i guess they ran out of i would have tried if they had it.
0,i dont eat fish so i would like to see more meat options in the entree section.
0,they do offer quite a few pastas that sound good
0,Took my Mom here for dinner after a walk in Astoria Park
0,"The serving sizes are smaller than the gluttonous sizes in most restaurant, but it is plenty and no waste of food."
0,"FRIGGIN' AWESOME!My boyfriend and I were excited to go out and try a new Italian restaurant that had just opened in Astoria, which will remain nameless."
0,"After getting a good whiff of garlic and cheese, we realized that ours were as well so we headed on over to 34th Ave and we were SOOOOO HAPPY we did.We arrived around 8 on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait as we opted to sit inside (most of the outside tables were taken as people enjoyed the weather)."
0,"I wish I had a food critique's repertoire of food adjectives that I could use other than amazing because I don't know how else to describe it.The atmosphere was nice, relaxed, and unpretentious."
0,"Each plate kept getting better and better, but had we eaten the plates in reverse I would say the same."
0,The burrata on the crostino was so rich and creamy.
0,The veal meatballs are indescribably tender and perfectly seasoned in a sweet traditional marinara.
0,The rigatoni had such a rich flavor between the jowl and the onions.
0,And the pork chop my word
0,It was perfectly cooked and on a bed of broccoli rabe and cannellini beans
0,Make a awful sauce that stayed with my taste buds for the rest of the night
0,"I have a feeling that a lot of people enjoy being seen here, rather than eating, as the food and service was definitely subpar when it comes to what you can find in Astoria."
0,"I then- completely calmly and politely, told the owner that Locale is one of my favorite restaurants, and we love coming there, but we can't if they don't understand the complexities of GF cooking."
0,"I try and not be that guy to write something off after only visiting once, but I will not be visiting Locale again and figure I would share my experience since it seems that many people have strong positive feelings about this restaurant."
0,"Candles ( the real type, not the battery operated), high ceiling, high windows with white drapes create an almost urban gothic setting."
0,"While the menu offers up many Italian dishes there's also a selection of other fare, such as crab cake appetizer, cornish hen and salmon."
0,We started with an appetizer of fried calamari.I liked the fact that I could see actual slices of garlic in the dipping sauce.
0,Fortunately water refills were plentiful and overall service was spot on.Up next was my main course of pappardelle and lamb ragu.
0,And in the right corner pappardelle
0,"And as referee a large clump of goat's cheese...ding ding ding, let's get ready to eat!Fortunately I was able to stir it all up and the result of my labor was delicious."
0,"So delicious that I was scraping my plate in the hope that some more could magically appear.On a serious note, the portion did tend towards the small end of the spectrum and I observed the same with my wife's cornish hen so an appetizer is recommended.With room left for dessert, we decided to share an order of the apple nutella cobbler."
0,"Stepping away from the preceding sentence, I do wish that there was a bit more noticeable nutella flavor on top so my first few bites would not be in vain."
0,"That's a very minor critique and in no way interfered with the enjoyment of this dish.The appetizer, two entrees, dessert and a soda came to $60."
0,"If I return to this part of Astoria, I'd have to do the locale-motion again."
0,Choose whatever version you prefer Perfect place for brunch
0,"After contemplating about coming here for nearly 2 years now, I finally set a day and time to come here...and it was completely worth the wait!"
0,I figured it would be quiet since it was the day before New Years Eve and just a few days after Christmas.
0,Who would of thought
0,One word to describe it  AMAZING
0,"This review is for the former as I was feeling the hunger pains and so opted for a table for two.The decor is definitely easy on the eyes, creating a sense of intimacy that's perfect for conversation and relaxation."
0,so we couldn't split our bill as planned.
0,"The Low Points:-Took forever to get someone to take our order (10 minutes when you're hungry is an eternity)-Took forever to get our food (I only complain because there were people who sat down after us getting theirs before us plus it wasn't a full house by any means)-Food was obviously just sitting out as it was barely lukewarm-The ""special"" was a sad sight to behold with 2 thin slices of chicken breast with 5 pieces of broccoli and 5 pieces of cut baby potatoes-The food honestly reminded me of airplane food (you know, THAT taste)-Took forever to get the checkOh and for the icing on the cake, the ""special"" Chicken Marsala turned out to be $17.99 and the credit card minimum was something stupid like $20 (I hate that crap!)"
0,"And I'm really sad that I can clearly never return to this restaurant that has such a great atmosphere, and delicious food."
0,"(which, for the record, the menu didn't specify)I told him that the chef claimed it was GF, but we understand that he may not have realized that the fryer could contaminate, but they really should know that."
0,I mentioned BareBurger as an example of a place that has a dedicated deep fryer for GF customersHe got really upset about this and told us Bareburger doesnt use organic meat and do you know who my chef is
0,So then the owner comes up again and says what do you think youre trying to pull
0,"I said I would pay if that was the case, and then he went to get the bill, but then reconsidered, and told us, ""just get out of my restaurant and stop bothering my customers."
0,We dont want your business
0,"There were in fact many customers that looked mortified at the whole ordeal, and even one who told us she was a celiac and could not believe the owner's attitude.Anyway, the whole thing was so absurd it was kind of funny."
0,(for those of us not concerned with allergies)  I feel truly sorry for the staff that works for this guy.
0,What a let down for brunchCame here to Locale with my friend Chris a few weeks ago to try it out and was really disappointed with the overall experience
0,"In the end, all he had to say was ""I'm sorry, we didn't realize, is there anything we can do to fix this?"""
0,but apparently that would require him to swallow his clearly not gluten-free pride!
0,No French fries on weekends 
0,No wine after 11
0,Feels like moms right around the corner about to ground you if you keep your elbows on the table 
0,Wanna be bougie
0,First impression cool Laid back atmosphere  professional caring staff
0,Im obsessed with the Mmm Mm Mimosa
0,Bad choice for cold weather.The entrance hall added to the front door has one fatal flaw which the restaurant management seems to have missed.
0,All-around everything was pretty good that hit my table.
0,"Now, I'm also real strong at creating and making my own omelettes so unless your serving crisp, non clumpy  hash browns, not the case here, have fresh squeezed OJ that's squeezed from Brooklyn Decker's nipples or make the most mouth watering, respectable pork alternative such as home made sage turkey sausage, I'm not going to lose any sleep over missing out on the peak-less ride."
0,Having a boorish brunch these days when you consider  all the recipe knowledge at your finger tips is like having boring sex with woman that were taught Sex Ed on Bang Bus
0,The side salad was very good and complemented the light dishes perfectly.
0,We dont drink caffeine so we asked for decaf and were surprised by how delicious it was
0,"I loved the atmosphere (huge, floor-to-ceiling windows), our waitress was delightful, and ohmygosh the food."
0,Soo good for brunch
0,"Also, I originally wanted to order the Lamb Hash Benedict on the menu, which was not available that day, at which point I was told about the special (doesn't that usually happen before you order?"
0,This is the type of review you get after I watch Dices new Showtime special Invincible
0,Fantastic new flare and direction to a alwaysgreat brunch
0, I dont know how it took me so long to try this place out given its trendy ambiance and alluring outdoor seating but I finally made it for brunch this morning with a friend
0,We were seated right away with none of the typical Astoria wait at noon
0,My friend and I ordered the goat cheese and baby spinach omelette with home fries and the belgian waffles with berries and cream to share and both were delicious beyond my expectations
0,I think they might put some almond extract into the whipped cream; it definitely has something extra to it which makes it unbelievably tasty.
0,The service was great and the prices were much more reasonable than I expected; I think with tip and tax we ended up spending about $13 each.
0,The rap song in honor of Dice at the end is the best part by the way.
0,"That's like blowing off those cheap, easy to slam posh blond twins from Basketball Diaries in exchange for a wannabe, more bug eyed,  Zooey Deschanel.But if I lived closer to Kaufman Studios or god for bid got a staff writer job for Nurse Jackie when it was filmed there,  I'd revisit Locale to see if all the Yelp hype was justified or just another example of wannabe Queens hipsters pumping up a so so brunch spot in order to feel better about their locale."
0,I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a meal when every 10 seconds there is a 20 degree wind chill blowing at you.
0,"Although the puree was good, there an excess of it that it was unproportional to the small 6-8 scallops."
0,I guess he can't be bothered with making more of it.
0,"I think if it wasn't for the miserable cold that we experienced for the duration of our meal i would rate this place at 4 stars as the interior is bright and pleasant and the food, while not spectacular, is good enough to come back for."
0,Had no trouble making a reservation
0,The service was great and the two picky pregnant women at the table were well taken care of by our server.
0,The restaurant was very small yet cozy and nicely decorated for NYE.
0,The outside was crisp and the inside was soft and risotto was soft and perfectly cooked.Scallops- it needed a sear.
0,"Gnocchi with pumpkin sauce- great, it was very creamy."
0,"It's snug in parts and means well yet never makes you feel like your missing out either.If I still lived in Astoria, would I drive there and lose my spot when I could go to Vesta or the Astor Bake Shop instead, no, of course not."
0,It might have needed a tad bit more sauce.
0,"Either way, the lamb ruined the sauce and it tasted  very gamey."
0,"The foie gras even before I found out what it was, I could just feel the fat particles bouncing off my tongue."
0,"Both of these elements made the overall dish too salty.ricotta cheese cake- very good.chocolate caramel pudding- I thought it was too chocolatey, even with the ice cream and I love my share of chocolate."
0,"We waited a while for an outside table even though there were a few open (which bugged me a bit), but everyone was very nice."
0,For an appetizer we got the Bruschetta Trio and we loved itFor an entree I got the chicken special which was chicken stuffed with mozzarella and spinach and wrapped with bacon and it was amazing
0,After 15mins of being ignored  not even a glass of water really
0,Our group ordered a wide variety of appetizers which all happened to be seafood.
0,"The waiters are inconsistent, too."
0,She didn't seem to mind it much but she would later say it was just ok.I ordered the smoked salmon crostino with greens (trying to be healthy).
0,There are so many amazing things about this restaurant that I can't name a bad trait yet!
0,Its become our new goto
0,I could've eaten a whole brunch of JUST those.
0,"My first gripe was the gravy, it was watery and tasted like they simply took a bit of hollandaise sauce and put some pan drippings in it to darken the color."
0,Country gravy is supposed to be thick and milk based made with chunks of sausage and sausage grease loaded with pepper and spice
0,"My second issue with the extremely thin buttermilk biscuit it arrived on, i'm going to guess the kitchen forgot the leaving agent because this thing was more like a dense pancake.TLDR Summary; Stick with the italian food and avoid the biscuits and gravy."
0,The water was great; it was all down here from there.
0,Just a cool place to get a drink I would have given your location 4 stars if the bartender would have not gotten upset over the fact that I pointed out my glass was dirty.
0,We also had the eggs benedict over a biscuit with gravywhich was delicious
0,As for the decor it's very hip and calls you in.
0,"On a positive note the bartender did change her attitude at the end, but the 1st impression is the last impression."
0,Ate here recently
0,This place is extremely affordable- my sandwich was only about $12 and came with a salad or fries.
0,Perfectly romatic place to finish off our movie night.
0,"It was our first time there and the decor from the outside drew is in although the ratings were not very high.I ordered the Bloody Mary to start and I must say, it had all the works but the taste was uninspiring."
0,I do have suggestions on improving the taste of the salad and roasted potatoes which prevents me to give it a full five stars
0,I especially love the bread as it gave it a crunch texture from every bite you take
0,Gastroteca is on 33rd if you want great food!
0,From the outside the place looked amazing for my wifes anniversary celebration diner

0,Amazing place found while passing by 34th Avenue
0,Amazing food specially the Rizzoto matriciana
0,"There are some reviews about waiting long for food, well the food is fresh-- and fresh food can sometimes take a little longer to cook then frozen fries in a deep frier!"
0,If you love cheese then this is a great way to explore your cheese buds
0,"Soft, gooey, yummy cheese that you won't be able to get enough of!"
0,Unique and creamy flavor yet not as heavy as it looked which was great if youre not a fan of truffles then this is not for you
0,Probably should have tried the french toast because it looked amazing from other tables The 10 discount deal was a plus
0,This corner spot has a very peaceful vibe with wide/tall windows.
0,"Robert, Anna, and (I believe his name is) Igor are the best!"
0,"In it was cauliflower, celery, pickle and an olive amongst other fashionable ingredients but the flavor of the drink tasted watered down with only a bit of spice to show for it.For food, my girl got the California Benedict."
0,The salmon was fishy and when I took a bite of the salad and I felt some sand but I hoped it was my imagination and finished the first bite.
0,We had a variety of meals (party of 3) and everything was wonderful!
0,"When I pointed this out to a server, he told me he'd get our server to fix it but the check came back with no revisions, forcing me to get up, go to the bar and make it more obvious.My final (and additional) thoughts on this place is that the employees are there more to socialize than to actually work a living."
0,"Definitely assumed they would be, you know, BAKED."
0,"But when I got them, they were completely runny - almost like they'd just cracked them and thrown them in."
0,Food pretty good homefries undercooked
0,My roommate seemed happy with her dish as well however the side of bacon left something else to be imagined.
0,"The crostini were great as well, ordered the Sicilian pineapple (husband's favorite), fig jam, and eggplant (my favorite)."
0,Negative brunch experience
0,More in the whattaya gonna do
0,Come on man
0,It would have been the least you could do for making us wait so long for appetizer-sized brunch plates which ranged in price from $9.50-$15.00 plus beverages.Luckily I used my Yelp promo code to get 10% off the bill.
0,It definitely showsThe best part  my portobello benedict had undercooked eggs
0,Should have gone there or anywhere else for that matter

0,They had zoo lander on the projector and I cried at the end.

0,****check the restaurants website for current menu...menu posted on this page is not current and slightly different Really good Italian food!
0,Had some crostinis to start all were delicious
0,Tiramisu was light and fluffy...I usually like more espresso flavor but it was still good.
0,It is on the pricey side but if you want to treat yourself to some nice Italian this would be the place to do it
0,At first I was thinking a bit pricey but the quality was outstanding.
0,"Enjoyed crostini with ricotta and honey, but Lamb ribs very overdone - not much edible meat."
0,The steak is soft and had the right gravy over them.
0,My only complaint is that they can be a bit inconsistent in flavor some days being better than others.
0,"Service was helpful when recommending specialty cocktails, however 4 drinks for our table took what felt like an eternity to receive."
0,Über random but charming
0,Per our server it's usually old black and white films.
0,The place itself was airy and was comfortable even sitting at the bar due to not having a reservation
0,Found quick seats at the bar
0,It smelled so bad I almost thew up.
0,"Also a honorary mention: the Cappuccino was surprisingly good - aromatic, strong, and smooth with the perfect amount of foam.I took one star off because the toilet was kinda a mess."
0,Together with the butter and syrup glazed waffle it was a fulfilling and delicious combo
0,Occasion: Sunday brunch with a friendFood:Italian Fried Chicken with Waffle ($18)CappuccinoThe fried chicken was cooked very well - retaining the right balance of moist and crunchiness.
0,"The bread was crunchy/crispy outside, but doughy inside."
0,"My iced coffee was not rich at all, though, too plain and watery."
0,My crostini with smoked salmon (and ricotta and this insane spicy jam/compote and perfect sunny side eggs) was probably the best thing I've ordered in a very long time!!!
0,Flavor explosion in my mouth!I also opted for the side salad which was fresh arugula and radicchio tossed in a fresh vinegary dressing - I could NOT stop eating that!!
0,"Husband ordered the Italian Benedict which he LOVED - it had parmacotto (cooked prosciutto - MEATY and DELICIOUS), and we were amazed that we had never had this before!!"
0,We shared the zeppoles to end our meal - we were so full we couldn't eat more than 2 a piece.
0,It was so good we literally made reservations for the weekend after for brunch while paying our check!
0,Its a simple plate and they let the ingredients speak for themselves  SO refreshing and delicious
0,"It was a little difficult to eat as the crostini is a huge slice of bread, would have been better for them to cut it up into two portions perhaps."
0,"It's already great texture-wise, initially crunchy and then chewy on the inside."
0,Then you add the pesto sauce and shaved ricotta and its a done deal
0,The portion looks small at first but it fills you up fast.
0,I couldn't help myself from stealing some off her plate.
0,The waffle tasted really distinct (but good) and it was soft but a bit crunchy at the same time.
0,None of us could finish our dish.
0,"-- The mascarpone cheese was sweet but not too thick, although the fried chicken was okay."
0,"-- The polenta was so creamy and buttery, and the scampi was so chewy; the tomato sauce (I guess) was so delicious that had the perfect sourness and went so well with the scampi."
0,Yet drinks were served fairly quickly before ordering foodMy friends got Scampi and Grits 16 and Chicken and Waffle 18 with 2 fried eggs and home fries
0,"Pros: free coffee refills, clean restrooms, clean restaurant, outdoor seating available, and decent serviceDo not order crispy gnocchi if you're hungry."
0,"It Can be a bit noisy at times inside when busy, but thats every where with great food."
0,I definitely recommend getting outside seatings in springsummer timeGreat staple for weekend brunch  dog friendly
0,They also do not have wifi for customersI ordered crispy gnocchi for 16
0,Not worth 16
0,"My other friend created her own brunch meal: wheat toast, two scrambled eggs, and home fries."
0,Their meals were not small like mine.
0,4 stars for the ambiencedecorwaiterstheir spinach gnocchi actually everything
0,Its fine if you come in a group and you have a lot to chat to kill the wait time
0,"U get great dinner , breakfast & brunch.and I like how a Black&white movie runs in the background- perfect setup for a date too.Food is great as well but it could be better and healthier ."
0,Got there  change our table to seat outside
0,We got seated on the corner of this restaurant
0,It is topped with egg
0,So we called another waitress & ask for menu so we can double check the sandwich.
0,Its weird because the pesto is more expensive than the other one with avocado & we ask for chicken sandwich.
0,"Our waitress also came by a little too often to check on our table - and it really seemed like she was rushing us... we felt a bit uncomfortable.Overall, a very average brunch spot."
0,The California Benedict comes with two poached eggs sitting atop  mashed avocado and two mini tomatoes on small ciabatta rolls.
0,If youre hungry then this dish prob wont fulfill your appetite
0,"We had to wait for over 30 minutes, which was okay because I really like to relax during brunch rather than shoving everything down quickly.The food arrived very cold, which kinda ruined every good things I just listed above."
0,It must have taken at least 30 minutes for two CAPPUCCINOS.
0,"The restaurant was mildly busy, but coffee shouldn't take that long."
0,And if its that busy or youre short staffed just check in with your customers
0,We can be understanding.
0,The staff was excellent and catered to our requests quite gracefully.
0,We ordered goat cheese omlette and chicken sandwich (our waiter was kind enough to accept my request to substitute grilled chicken for fried cutlet).
0,"Besides the rotten part, the cutlet was good (I feel weird saying this btw).Don't think I will be returning here."
0,"We also shared the nutella french toast, which had to be taken to go since we definitely over ordered.The really disappointing part was how long it took for our food to come."
0,"Our server then tells us that she heard that there were some price changes ""last week"" but was not sure and that she had to speak to someone regarding this."
0,"Then some guy comes out and talks to our server right behind us talking very loud and clear about this situation as if they wanted us to listen and says, ""Someone must have brought up our old menus from storage."
0,But you can take out the 6 dollars from their bill.
0,Just sounds like a bunch of bs to me
0,"As for food, we ordered the CALIFORNIA BENEDICT, SCAMPI & GRITS and ITALIAN FRIED CHICKEN & BUTTERMILK WAFFLE with a side of HOME FRIES and APPLEWOOD SMOKED BACON."
0,"Portions were pretty big, we all had some leftovers."
0,Not just food but cappuccinos
0,Natural lighting all around so go nuts  We didnt have a reservation It was a Saturday afternoon but they were able to seat us at the bar
0,I will say that the eggs were poached perfectly and although the dish was rather small it was still quite tasty!
0,What a nice way to make a classic dinner dish into breakfast
0,The patty was bigger than the bun which is a plus in my book.
0,Our waiter was attentive and quick with servicing us with a full water vase when we finished ours.
0,Had an excellent rehearsal dinner here recently
0,Absolutely loved the Zeppoles with Nutella syrup to start
0,The Chef makes an amazing Italian Fried Chicken  Waffles with agro dolce  mascarpone butter
0,They brought over this home made balsamic maple syrup to the table and it complements the chicken really well.
0,It is better if you make a reservation
0,If you are a foodie and love to take pics then this restaurant is also for you lol
0,"It fills up quickly here.Good brunch menu, I wanted to try crostinos-they are only served during dinner but I was still happy with my dish."
0,I got Scampi and grits - it was delicious with generous portions my bf had eggplant burrata sandwich plate with fries- sandwich wasn't filled at all 80% bread with 1 slice of eggplant.
0,"We also got eggs California  Benedict which was ridiculously tiny-literally 4 bites, the portions are definitely skewed depending on what you get so beware.Service was good no complaints there and the Place is spacious well lit."
0,"Also the Belgium waffle my gf order was fluffy and tasty I can't go more into details because she didn't want to give me half hahaha, but from what I tasted it worth the purchase if you are into waffle."
0,"Resturant wise: Furthermore, the atmosphere of the place was welcoming; the staff was polite and very attentive."
0,I been to other restaurants that they would just sit you take your order and that about it.
0,"The space is spacious with high brick walls, two levels, outdoor seating, a comfortable bar, and subtitled movies playing."
0,"The burrata with lightly pickled spring vegetables, charred shallots, and agrodolce was the freshest I've had outside Italy."
0,Theres a good selection of primi piatti and secondi
0,Id say make a reservation through opentable though as the place did fill up
0,"The brunch Bloody Mary comes with a side of salad- carrots in a Bloody Mary are a surprise- because when I'm finished with the olive, the pickle, the cucumber, the carrot has soaked up a delivers the rest of the booze with a crunch."
0,Good stuffCrispy Gnocchi w pistachio spinach basil pesto ricotta salate perfect
0,NOTE don't order the chicken club sounds good but it's not happening very dull and tasteless.
0,Overall decent for only breakfast not recommend for lunch or dinner
0,"We were originally sad to see ""Locale"" go, and we enjoyed it a lot then."
0,The reboot is extremely successful.
0,"The cocktails were delicious they had mango, passion and regular mimosas, mojitos, bloody marys and my personal fave, the ""Freddy Krueger"" which was a very special bloody Mary with a peppered rim, and goat cheese stuffed olive and of couse, the celery stick!!!"
0,"YummyThe atmosphere is nice and cozy, feels like you are in someone's living room."
0,High ceilings curtains beautiful wallpaper and lots if windows
0,I rarely venture into Queens but will be doing so more because of my experience at Gastroteca!
0,It was simultaneously country/rustic but had that trendy white brick walls and bright red wood for all the tables.
0,We had made a reservation for 12p on a Saturday and it wasnt too packed but by 1130 it became much more crowded
0,(0.5 point knocked off for the smell of smoke on our waiter from his seemingly recent smoke break)I got one of their eggs benedict specials with roasted potatoes and bacon the side.
0,All very fresh and wellprepared
0,All with good reason!Locale has consistently great food that won't make your wallet cry in the morning.
0,The former Local still offers up the same American/Italian fare under a completely different name.
0,dug this place a lot
0,sometimes you just like shiz as simple as possible
0,"Guess she nor anyone else there cared much for that.Overall, our two dishes were great and where we got seated was nice including the overall decor of the restaurant."
0,"The seats were very comfortable, which made the hike through the storm worth it."
0,And than stuffed generously with Nutella with a side of syrup
0,"...OYEah.I got the portobello bendict with wilted spinach and truffle oil...Not a typical dish I would order since there's no meat in it, but it did the job."
0,Had homefries on the side but didnt care much for it
0,So the meals were perfect but drinks..not so much.
0,Wait but ask us how our food was
0,"Minor details need work on but I would not mind coming back... Perhaps, I was reconnecting with a homegirl over wine, talkin' about love, spirituality and the calm after the storm."
0,tasted simpler here at Locale and juicier
0,And this joint made it feel zen
0,"Sweet waitress, fast ass service, lightning bolt bartender....and it was chill and quiet (despite being busy) and lovely.Skatefish appetizer with avocado puree was delish, slightly battered and fried."
0,Kinda like a salt filling magnet you know
0,Silky and gulpy
0,dont listen to them wine buffs about white with fish
0,An entree like the duck breast
0,"Its comparable to a lot of really good meals you'll have in Manhattan with a shave off the price, less competition for a table, and much less pretentiousness."
0,This place is great for a low-key brunch or a big pow-wow.
0,"When making the reservations, I had to call twice to make an update to the time & headcount and the staff was super accommodating, which was well appreciated & constitutes a note-worthy mention."
0,I asked the waiter if I could have another glass of wine and I would pay cash on a separate check.
0,"The food is small portioned but great and our server was doing anything he could to accommodate us, but what I am assuming is the management is lacking majorly here."
0,We came one Friday or Saturday night made a reservation through open table
0,checked in and waited at our table for the other members of our group
0,We asked if French fries were possible or a spaghetti with marinara?
0,"No and no ""No French fries on Fridays""  I could tell in the servers face hat he was embarrassed and said I'll see what I can do, he spoke to the manager and came back with a disappointed face."
0,I rarely ever finish my entire plate of food...so that means it was great but honestly very small portions  for the price.
0,"The food was good, and I have always wanted to try brunch here but maybe when management takes a course in accommodating guests, I'll think about it."
0,There was a hornet buzzing around my girlfriend that I had to kill; I'm not sure if I should give a star for the opportunity to save her life or take a star away for allowing a hornet into the restaurant.
0,Drinks are a bit on the expensive size and foo portion size is somewhat small.
0,New management so some new menu items --- shrimp and grits are very good.
0,Mango mojito is still solid.
0,"The decor remained the same, still airy and cool, menu seemed similar."
0,Prices for brunch were high in comparison to portion size.
0,Not ready to give up on this place
0,But then again I guess thats the price you have to pay for having an open air restaurant and serving food with syrup
0,"Food was overly salty and I waited for for far too long to be served- which I could understand if it was packed, but frankly, it wasn't."
0,"The dining area was spacious and both inviting and comfortable with ample outdoor seating, for those that wish to dine al-fresco!"
0,I honestly loved everything and have no complaints other than that I completely forgot to use my 10 off yelp coupon but thats my own fault
0,"We ordered a number of different dishes including the smoked salmon crostini, steak & eggs, and nutella french toast to name a few."
0,"The smoked salmon was fresh and complemented nicely with the aioli spread served with a fried egg on top and the nutella french toast was a star of its own, as it was devoured quickly among the group."
0,I couldn't have imagined any other way to spend a Saturday brunch with friends!
0,Kudos to Locale for being a neighborhood gem
0,"Perfect since it was such a rainy night!Started with three Crostinos: bacon and black pepper aioli, burrata with white bean hummus and tomato sauce, and a special one with roasted garlic purée, basil, and (I forget which) cheese."
0,How do you do thatFor dessert we shared the coconut panna cotta with coconut sorbet and guava soup and the dark chocolate cake with burnt orange ice cream
0,"When the food arrived it was cold, and honestly for the price the presentation and portions were underwhelming.Leslie D. got the special which $17 something for a chicken breast and some veggies, it looked pretty un-appetizing to say the least.Overall it was just bad and I left hungry and annoyed, bottom line is there is so many good brunch places closer than me with way better deals for brunch and i will not be coming back here."
0,And the bartender was super friendly (like every bartender should be) and it as hilarious watching my older brother trying to get her number HAHAHA!!
0,Came here for New Years brunch and luckily got seated within 10 minutes
0,My initial impression of this place was that the atmosphere was cute.
0,"But unfortunately, the experience was ruined due to the lack of service my table received."
0,"This place hit the spot my mom is super picky like every other Hispanic older woman, and she was so impressed and loved it!!!!"
0,"From the moment you walk in, the host was super friendly with an awesome tattoo!"
0,"The waiter was super nice, patient, and helpful he was trying to help us figure out what we wanted(just like every waiter should be) 100points!!!!"
0,Great choice for cold weather.Great design by the folks at Locale for incorporating an additional pathway onto the front door that prevented the cold draft from creeping into the restaurant every time someone opens the door.
0,"The music is catchy too that they play but it be even more awesome if they played some old school vinyl records or hits to match the decor, maybe not every night but it be a welcome change up from hearing the music you usually hear on the radio....actually a good balance would be finding bands like Scott Bradlee and Post Modern Jukebox who takes pop hits and transforms them to motown verisons etc...playing their music from time to time would really add to the unique atmosphere provided by the space and help separate it further from the generic ultra modern spots in Astoria.Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner for a date, family outing and groups of friends."
0,"The wine list is not extensive, but comprehensive and is well priced, as is the food.Astoria is an easy trip from Manhattan, so don't be daunted."
0,"I ordered a medium and it came out closer to well done.Wait staff is very attentive and smiles al around and it shows they like where they work, which is great to see compared to other restaurants in are where they look like theyre counting down the minutes to go home.The decor of the place is what I'd call vintage 2.0 where early 1900s meets modern conveniences throughout such as built in speakers for music and tvs around."
0,"If they can shorter the wait time and add brunch special to the drinks, i would definitely return."
0,"It's a super solid brunch spot but just a few more things and it could have been a four star or higher restaurant/brunch spot.But first off, props to the bartender who was also our server."
0,"We were seated at the bar during a busy Sunday (although coincidentally a few minutes later a few seats opened up) and our bartender was not only able to keep up with her busy position but was also able to take our order, have the food come out quickly, and was checking in on us and refilling our water or soda without even asking."
0,Fantastic service from her.Now what may have stopped the review from being a full on four star review was that although the food was satisfying and tasted just great it didn't really stand out too much.
0,She had ordered a side of sausage which...was more like a beef patty and didn't have much flavor to it.The home fries were home fries.Overall it was a good experience and I'd be willing to come back here to try other things on the menu.
0,"Brunch was perfection - The Bloody Mary I got to start was delicious and the terracotta with eggs, cheese, beans, mushrooms and kale was well worth the 20 minutes it takes to make."
0,"Nice ambiance, okay items on menu but not what I'd consider very brunch able."
0,"The shrimp scampi is very good, but I don't like runny eggs and I asked for them to be cooked but they must've forgotten and it was mixed in with scampi so pointless to ask them to redo so I managed."
0,the sugar toast however is very sweet & artery clogging fattening.
0,Consistently nice service.
0,Walk in 5 open tables
0,But were told by a condescending hostess that they were all reserved
0,We were lookin around as to where we could hang out jackets.
0,And threw her hands up as if to say youre on your own
0,I dont think wanting to hang our jackets is a luxury
0,Not to mention one of the fan was kind of broken.
0,"However, during a hot day, they only have fans on which was very hot and humid inside the restaurant."
0,Away from the main street region with a little bit of peace
0,All that hype and commotion for 17
0,Its worth getting on a subway or going over the bridge
0,"Big mistake.Sure, the place is gorgeous."
0,Classy urban decor akin to a West ElmPottery Barn hybrid
0,The second one comes to take our orders doesnt even bother to explain the specials or dessert of the day and then saunters off to a big family who was celebrating a birthday and sticks to them for the rest of the night completely ignoring us can you make it any more obvious you were hustling for the tip
0,We ordered calamari to start which was good can you really go wrong with that
0,I was finished within a few forkfuls
0,"I could've made a better version of my rigatoni.We wanted creme brulee, and then we're told they're out of tiramisu, creme brulee, and some other thing."
0,The atmosphere was casual with large industrial windows allowed natural light into the restaurant.
0,I'm still regretting it.Overpriced mediocre food with spotty service along with multiple unavailable items on the menu?
0,"I plan to come back to try more of their menu, but if the rest of it is anything like the embarrassing scoop of spaghetti that they were trying to pass off as cacio e pepe, I'm not optimistic."
0,We LOVED the 50s-70s music playing and the hangman game going on at the bar.The menu is mostly Italian with a modern twist.
0,"So hard to choose which was the best, but I'd say my favorite was the last- can't resist a runny yolk!."

0,They do get friendly wi the toppings

0,The crostinis are delicious and each one is easily shareable by two people so you can sample and discover your favorites.The mussles here in the garlic sauce were perfect.

0,"Foodwise, the calamari was very good as were the mussels and a pasta special with shrimp and sausage."
0,The crostini's were just OK..I've definitely had better elsewhere and the beet salad was meh.
0,"Sadly, some other b*tchy lady came up and said No, 10% off is only for parties of 4 or less - wait what?"
0,I decided not to argue because there were so many of us and it was not worth making a scene but come on..don't advertise a deal if you are not going to let yelpers use it.
0,"It doesn't specify anywhere that its for parties of 4 or less.Overall, I'd go elsewhere or just stop in here for a quick drink."

0,"I saw him manhandle his waitress to make sure his son had plenty of organic juice, while the waitress was clearly swamped and in the weeds, we had been waiting 50 minutes for our order of fish, and this guy's kid gets three servings of juice as soon as his glass is empty."
0,"(Meanwhile, the guy eating at the bar's had an empty glass as long as I could stare at it!)"
0,Told me if I didn't want mushrooms with my order that I should've ordered it that way - which I didn't!
0,Then he switched gears and told me I should've ordered something without mushrooms if I hate them so much.
0,noticed that two visits ago
0,"That's not a big deal since table service is still alright - especially during brunch - but if you want good Italian especially during peak hours, I'd suggest going a little deeper into queens."

0,Chef made a mistake with my order but it was fixed in seconds and it was delicious
0,I must say for once in my life I can thank the nightmarishly scarce parking condition for helping me find this Astoria gem.If you were to only try one thing at Locale it would have to be the Crispy Zucchini.
0,"After one bite of her entree I was trying to think of ways to overtake her meal and have it as my own.With a tastefully appointed interior, a well stocked bar and some outdoor seating Locale provides a great spot for a workday lunch, Sunday brunch or an intimate date night."

0,Maybe had more seasonal choices.
0,Its modern but elegant
0,However there was 90s music blaring the entire time
0,I though the selections were odd.
0,There was a spicy and rock hard asiago a truffle fontina and a some type of blue
0,They didn't match up with one another very well  and the bread they served with it was slightly burnt.

0,Locale makes GREAT pasta.
0,If you know anything about organic meat you know that the cows are not as fat as regular cows
0,"I find that preferable to the fish dishes I've tried at Locale.I've had a few of their appetizers too, which range from forgettable (I can't remember which ones, ha ha), to pretty horrible (fried artichokes tasted like fried nothing).But really, the pasta there is GREAT."

0,Maybe an honest mistake but dont know how that could have happenedWe were seated at a table outside on the sidewalk
0,The sauce was sooooo nasty.
0,One of those dishes that will make you want to slowly savor the experience
0,Additionally to all the tastiness the service was quite special.
0,"Purdy Fantastic Brunch!Been living around the corner for over a year and just ate here yesterday, I've got to say I was quite impressed on a number of levels.We stopped in for brunch and I did the Southern Omelet (substituted some awesome Polish sausage for the grilled chicken) and the thing was enormous and was a real winner in the flavor department!"
0,The brownie with caramelized marshmallow was perfect desert finisher!
0,Dont get the steak  it says it comes with a vegetable but its really a fried onion and the steak is definitely not worth it

0,All of the omelettes and eggs benedict are amazing
0,Brunch portions are substantial.Had a hot tea to counteract the rain.
0,"I guess ordering that is more of a southern thing and her bf doesn't know 1, how she can eat it and 2, how come she likes it so much.I got the portobello benedict."
0,If you don't get it on the side it will take over your plate and attack any kind of food flavors that are out in the open.
0,We actually had very attentive service and the host made sure we didn't forget our umbrellas as were were heading out into the mugginess that followed.
0,LOL Top it all off with wild greens and a fruit salsa and call me a happy girl

0,"None of the seating is comfortable, but if you're stuck in the lounge area, prepare to feel awkward."
0,"The pasta was mediocre, with odd peas."
0,Also other than the normal staff the new addition Katrina was excellent as our server.
0,"If she noticed we didn't seem happy, she should have addressed it right when she noticed by introducing herself as the manager and asking if everything was alright, like they do IN EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT in the world."
0,It's a semi romantic setting at night with dim lights.The food is good.
0,I would have rated this much higher if not for my most recent experience.
0,"They have a great space in the back of the restaurant that would probably be be great for a  little party or shower.As a note though, if you have a restaurant.com certificate for here, they won't honor it...a little unfortunate that they only comp'ed one dessert...but people have to make a living I guess."
0,Then I read a very interesting review by a local couple on their blog (see: Elizabeth S. 7/15/2012) and saw the response it got from Locale's owner.
0,"Manager was rude and horrible to staff AND customers, (looked to me like she was over her head and couldn't handle the hubbub of a busy din.)"
0,Its fresh creative yet simple and has a nice mix of items
0,Their staples are equally as good - the chicken and gnocchi are solid go-to's.The owner is especially attentive.
0,"He's usually there when we're dining, and always stops by to saw hi and check in on our experience, which I definitely appreciate.I'm getting hungry just writing this..."
0,"She didn't check how our food was, ask us if we wanted more drinks and my friend had wanted ketchup for her meal, yet it took over 10 minutes to get the waitress to even notice we needed something.Some other lady started coming by and we continued to try and enjoy each other's company and ignore the poor service."
0,Dont come to our table after we ate and paid to make sure everything is alright then act like a superior btch because youre the ohsoimportant manager
0,This woman was very abrasive.
0,Aloof
0,I didn't realize that word was too big for a high class manager such as yourself.
0,She continued to barrage us why didnt you say something why arent you looking at us when we come over etc etc
0,Listen lady we werent there to be your friends
0,You people are called servers for a reason youre there to serve us our food make sure we have what we need then get lost
0,A great respite from the hectic Manhattan scene and five minutes over the 59th street bridge
0,"A great date place, it's romantic and edgy, and if there is a lull in the conversation, you can talk about the silent movies projected on the wall, a nod to Kaufamn Movie Studios down the block."
0,"For drinks I had Rosemary's Garden which is rosemary-dill infused vodka, sauvignon blanc and a blue cheese stuffed queen olive."
0,Oozing with charmLocale looks like a 19th century European cafe frequented by Emile Zola and Cezanne
0,The owner of the restaurant even came around after we'd finished up to ask how we'd enjoyed his place.
0,How often do you find that in NYCWill certainly be back
0,Have you ever walked by one of those restaurants that look trendy and have a ton of people hanging out outside

0,Thats the vibe you get when you stroll by this restaurant
0,We were left to browse the menu and take in the surroundings
0,"The brunch menu was small, and the food was OK. Not bad by any means just not something that would blow your mind away."

0,"(The girl ate the sausage, so I can't comment on that.)"
0,Try the short rib risotto very rich but worth every penny
0,"Small intimate tables, great mood lighting, low key enough for a first date but also nice with friends (not particularly great for large parties id imagine because of the small space)."
0,Went with the girl for our six month anniversary.The portabello and goat cheese crustini salad was beautiful and tasty; just enough to start us off.
0,The Goat Cheese was just perfectly toasted and was my favorite part of the meal
0,Also well presented and succulent
0,"A little on the buttery side, which I am always cool with."
0,"It is, after all, just an omelet - something you can make at home easily."

0,The food alone is worth it though!

0,it was ok until you tasted the pear because it tasted of chicken
0,"which were pretty good.but i like to review food, i got a simple salad with walnuts and grilled pears."
0,To summarize  Strangely textured omelet odd tasting water an okay portobello mushroom benedict somewhat sweet mango mojito and hotdoglike sausage amounts to a mediocre brunch in terms of food
0,"We'll be back sometime, I think, but it's not my very first priority the next time we hire a babysitter."
0,"We shared a bunch of stuff: a perfectly medium cooked skirt steak with ""fries"" (really, just slices of baked potato) and baby arugula salad, blue crab stuffed ravioli (seriously, it was insane) as well as a flour less chocolate cake with gelato and fresh whipped cream."
0,"Not only was our server super attentive and well versed in menu options, the owner Johnny checked in to make sure everything was satisfactory and appreciated our patronage so much that he offered is a complimentary glass of port as a parting gift."
0,Thats service

0,"Each employee is allowed to add songs to the playlist each night, so they must have some cool people working here, or at least some okay people who listen to good music."
0,"Our waitress recited the specials without error, and gave great food recommendations.The special tomato-red pepper soup was delicious, but too big of a helping for an appetizer."
0,"The ""Southern Belle"" Buffalo Trace cocktail was exceptional."
0,Ordered 2 and probably should have ordered 3
0,(that's why I took off a star...)Really cute decor as well...
0,Its like a soho hotspot here in Astoria
0,As long as they keep serving the veal scaloppini with the spaetzle in truffle-chianti sauce then i will continue to come back.
0,Ambience is great but kitchen inconsistency is unfortunate.
0,Had a dinner here once that was really great but subsequent brunch and dinners have been mediocre.
0,Sexy setting and crowd
0,"The pasta itself  in both dishes were VERY al dente, it was barely edible and as an Italian restaurant you would expect that you get good pasta.So basically, if you want to try locale go for brunch and stay away from the dinner menu!"
0,"I never understand why places offer deals then get mad/surprised when people use them.After brunch (and paying), we were talking for a few more minutes and a guy came over and said ""waaaater?"""
0,Great place for a date since its comfortable and has some more intimate seating up on the platformed area.As enjoyable as it was I had a weird confrontation with someone on shift the night I visited when I tried to use my Yelp discount/promotion.
0,"Hopefully things worked out for her.They also would not let us try a wine we were offered after the bottle I wanted, and knew, was not available."
0,My service experience was not great but I think that it was rare- probably better usually.
0,We were sat promptly and given tap water immediately by a male server
0,We told him our coffees were coming but we'll order food.
0,Table next to us gets seated and they are offered bottled water

0,"), the toasted polenta and asparagus that is served with the chicken however was rather good."
0,"We also had the organic chicken, which was very dry ( I mean how can you mess up chicken?"
0,"The food off of the dinner menu however, was rather disappointing."
0,Dont come here on an empty stomach
0,"The waiter said that most people ate the zuchinni fries with their fingers like french fries, which I found difficult to do."
0,"One,  they gave me a substantial portion (two people could have shared this) and two, the fries are so skinny that they barely got any of sauce when I dipped them."
0,The zuchinni fries were really tasty.
0,"The pineapple mojito was beautifully delicious and I loved the heady mint scent coming from that drink.$85 for 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, tax, and tip."
0,Might try again though just to be certain
0,Good food just always packed so you have to call in advance so do sogreat place specially for breakfast two thumbs up
0,Have a small snack or coffee before coming here
0,unfortunately I do not remember her name but she was the most professional and most amicable waitress I have ever seen.
0,The inside is quaint with a small lounge area in the back and a nice bar on the side.We started with the fried zucchini appetizer which was surprisingly good.
0,"Cut shoestring style and fried, served with a slightly sweet tomato sauce that went well with the slightly salty zucchini.For our entrees we ordered the shrimp and english pea risotto and the parpadelle and lamb ragu."
0,"it's a really nice spot to have drinks and/or dinner on a weekday night.i have had dinner at this place twice now, where i ordered the mushroom ravioli the first time and the artichoke ravioli the second time."

0,Clams and pork
0,Very cute ambiance and friendly and professional service make Gastroteca a very solid Astoria brunch option right away.
0,I can't stop thinking about how bad of a brunch this was - i actually regret going there.The waiter was unwelcoming and cold.
0,I paid $15 and was not full.
0,I would be ashamed serving that as a brunch meal.
0,The gnocchi  dont expect to get full because the serving was about maybe a little more than half a cup
0,"I should've spoke up to management before we paid the check, but I was embarrassed to say anything in front of my guests."
0,What a shame of a place
0,"Great range of brunch beverages, and I would say average menu items."
0,Please tell them lite on the Nutella because they will overload that shit.
0,"A recent visit puts Gastroteca at four stars for me - I had the spinach/goat cheese omelette, which, though very well plated, was very over-done resulting in a somewhat unappetizing texture/.flavor on the eggs."
0,"The side salad and toast were good, albeit lacking any sort of punch."
0,"My dining companions seemed to enjoy some of the other menu items - particularly one of the eggs benedict dishes, which looked very good."
0,"The place has a rustic look that's very charming, the service was good and we were excited to try the food here."
0,What was really perplexing was the fact that the food looked so amazing however the taste was far from it
0,"I had a few bites of the chicken and waffles and the chicken was practically flavorless, it was as though they forgot to add any seasoning."
0,"I read fairly good reviews online about this place, so we gave it a try."
0,"They were playing the Magic Schoolbus on the wall above the bar which was actually rather cute, and was very kid friendly too."
0,It made this distinct flavor where you had the essence of a typical clam sauce but had the salty fatty quality you get from pancetta
0,The melty burrata seemed to give the sandwich some flavor but otherwise it was rather bland and felt like packing carbs
0,My bites of the my friend's risotto and gnocchi were delicious too.
0,No one went wrong with their choices.
0,"I would normally want to have an extra appetizer vs dessert, but this place knocked dessert out of the park!"
0,And the banana zepoleshello can you hear me Im in NY dreaming about you and me
0,Jesus these things were good.
0,"Well balanced with the gin, prosecco, earl grey syrup (so delicate) and light on the lemon it was a definite hit."
0,"Okay, the salad was pretty wimpy if we're being honest."
0,"My friends got the Spaghetti Carbonara (this was SO good, and topped with smoked bacon, a fried egg and pecorino cheese - what more can you want in your pasta?)"
0,The gnocchi itself was very fresh but with every bite I was searching for the flavor with it nowhere to be found.
0,In a pinch yes
0,"The decor, the menu selection, the layout of the place was a strong 5 in my book."
0,Bloody Mary special  thicker than your average BM mix which I dont mind at all but the flavor is definitely on the smokier side
0,The bourbon infused bacon bits were interesting but I don't think I'd order againI really loved the space and there were other items that looked intriguing enough that I would def come back for a second try.
0,So neat and cute with vibrant colors accenting the restaurants black and white base colorsWe each ordered a different brunch food off of the brunch menu I personally got the California benedict perfectly poached eggs with guacamole roasted tomatoes and Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin with delicious homefries
0,The zucchini are cut into really super skinny (think anorexic) shoe string fries.
0,The side salad had some mushy leaves.
0,My boyfriends moscow mule had mint in it so he said it definitely tasted like a mojito rather than a mule but it was fine cause he likes mojitos anyway so whatever
0,Tomato Bisque  greatCalamari  greatBlack Pasta  getting tired of saying its great but hey
0,I would come here for drinks because the bar looked pretty nice.
0,We had a very attentive waitress who was not too chatty (which I liked) and sat inside but next to a huge open wall onto the street - so virtually outside.
0,"I was worried because the pictures looked so dark, but the whole place opens up for brunch and is full of sunlight.We had cheddar polenta, homefries (they use some rosemary rub which is unexpected but tasty), spinach goat cheese omelet, and I got a chocolate latte which was pretty delicious.The food was good, but the environment was even better."
0,A really nice place for brunch and awesome that you can make reservations online!
0,"The menu is great (the drink menu as well), the food was very good, and the attention from both the staff and the owner was amazing.The corned beef hash eggs benedict was smashing, as was my drink, a red wine sangria based with Montepulciano (my favorite wine, it just so happens, for its fruity hints from the South of Italy)."
0,"With so many choices, of course we spazzed and got decaf chamomile.We'd been pestered by a bee, attracted to our sweet sangria."
0,"Rather than bringing out the toxic raid bee killer extreme 2000, the owner was kind and wise enough to place a bowl of honey out which apparently did the trick.I've eaten here many times for brunch and dinner and I love it here."
0,"It's a local establishment (no puns on the name), the food is good and everyone who I've encountered who works here has been extremely friendly.The managers and owner seems extremely receptive to feedback and will go out of their way to make for an excellent dining experience.By the looks of other reviews, I'm not the only one who left happy and on a full stomach....maybe a little tipsy though."
0,4 stars for great brunch ever changing dinner menu beautiful interior decor outdoor seating in the summer and friendly waiters and owner
0,Viva la Locale
0,Charm ambiance and quality in Queens
0,Plus no obnoxious scene
0,But I had to get my massage and with my condition sitting is the most painful thing for me.
0,After the distress my body was in at Taverna Kyklades (though the food was awesome) we decided I should not go out to eat  unless the restaurant has comfy chairs.So my husband was challenged to find some place that is clean and comfy and warm for me.
0,As several other reviewers said I wish I had found it sooner.The reason I needed to get brunch and get my massage so early is (or at least early for me) is our money pit apartment still needed additional work.
0,"I am not a picky eater, at all, but the spaetzle and sauce with my pork scaloppini were just yuck."
0,"I acknowledge the restaurant did get busy, but if a server can't come to the table at least once every 15min, even just to refill water, I don't feel appreciated.I wanted to like this place more because it is very local (hah!"
0,and the owner came over and asked if she wanted more gnocchi (thinking she didn't get enough on her plate...which she did...she just really liked the calamari and the gnocchi is great too..my personal favorite).
0,A safe choice
0,"Ok - I'm really not unreasonable but come on - you spill multiple drinks down the back of the guest of honor, replace them 35 minutes later, and then you tell me we're done?!"
0,No thank you - I'll take my overpriced average brunch bill and go.
0,For this the service gets a B.2.
0,"So many possibilities, so much promise, so little effort..."
0,Overall  rating
0,"There is nothing on the menu that has ever disappoint my myself or my guests, but I usually stick to the eggs benedict."
0,What more can you ask for
0,Also one of our guests were picking at some left over calamari (because it was so good!!)
0,Me and 7 friends made a reservation at Locale when we learned that they recently changed management and it was a great a great choice
0,"You can always tell whether an Italian restaurant is any good by the quality of the staples - calamari, pasta, wine, etc."
0,I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place.
0,My fiancé and I just had our engagement party brunch here and it was AMAZING
0,Our glasses were getting filled constantly and the food came out nice and hot for everyone!
0,"They personalized the chalkboard for us, played a picture slideshow of us, and provided really cute photo props for each table for our guests to enjoy!"
0,"So I got up early for the massage (they came in early for me) they do not really have set hours they will be there if they have customers, so we needed to eat and do errands to stay out until they were finished in our apartment.I thought of Sugar Freak but really the brunch is all high fat and high sugar."
0,There are no healthy choices at all
0,He choose it based on the pictures on their web site of their comfy seating.If you are outside of New York reading this you might not realize that many if not most New York restaurants lack decor space and ambaience.
0,I was also disappointed by the lack of a more comprehensive and inclusive brunch menu but I took no stars off for that as its not their fault that I have been spoiled by the Calle Ochos of the worldI ordered Rigatoni from the Specials menuIt was in a wine sauce and it was fantastic
0,Just make sure to make a reservation- even early for brunch I had to choose between a community high top table or bar seat (I did not care- but others may).
0,"We love the service, the wine menu, the food,and well the desserts are delish!"
0,The have an amazing cheese plate.They make some yummy cocktails although I usually get wine- I would recommend trying one of them.
0,The desserts and coffees are fantastic!
0,The place was kind of empty at about 3pm...The restaurant is a quaint open space...It has a nice ambiance about it.
0,I can see it being a cozy candle lit place at night..I took one star off because they sat us near the door in the winter in an otherwise empty restaurant and it was drafty...
0,My dining partner ordered breakfast and her food seemed to be quite delicious and she stated several times that she had a great meal and commented on the home fries.
0,There are many other place with more consistent food and way better levels of service.
0,However she always had a smile in her face and sunshine in her heartI would definitely recommend Locale as a place to go for brunch if you are in the area and unsure of where to eat
0,"I was quite impressed with my entree...I would say skip the liquor if you are value conscious...but really, the food can hold its own with the best of them..."
0,"The food at Locale is great, I've been here a couple times and was generally Wow'ed by every dish."
0,I love that they offer different variations of eggs benedict  theyre all delicious
0,"If you like a sweeter breakfast, they offer super decadent dishes (Belgian waffles/french toast/pancakes) as well."
0,Overall its always a positive experience at Locale
0,Sweet and attentive servers refills on coffee several types of eggs benedict and amazing bloody marys
0,"The flavor was good but the main ingredient was in small pieces and missing from the dish, and the consistency of the risotto was more like mashed potatoes- Grilled flank steak - meat was well seasoned, by dry and chewy."
0,It is stressful for me right now in my condition to deal with and isn't pleasant to go to most restaurants.
0,It came too rare for my taste and it was one of those really mushy burgers.
0,In NY you pay for comfort
0,There are so many restaurants that look clean but if you peak into the kitchen there is chaos and dirt.
0,We split the yogurt parfait
0,I was surprised to see that it is not a scene.Very low Key vibe.Others mentioned it is a nice date spot.
0,Which brings me to something we saw that was so adorable.
0,There were specials not on the menu on line as well as regulars ordering past specials not on the menu and the chef accommodated them.I am really charmed and look forward to going back soon!
0,"It doesn't justify the city-like costs though.You can find better options one more subway stop to broadway or better yet, two more to my hood at 30th ave.I am willing to give it another go and try something different on the menu - but am I just in denial?"
0,Too much pasta to meat in proportionsBad:- Mayan shrimp with yucca - shrimp was DOUSED in seasoning.
0,when we were offered more drinks and desert
0,The man must also have the patience of a saint
0,"As we were leaving some b**ch, who was apparently allergic to everything under the sun was complaining that the restaurant was running out of some of its evening specials and practically everything offered on the menu she was allergic to."
0,Well thats what happens when you go to dinner at 11 pm on a Saturday night what a horses a
0,The cherry cobbler was amazing
0,"We had to ask for the same things about 4 times, and some of what we asked for never made it to the table.Took forever to get the appetizers, and waited about another half an hour or more between when appetizers finished to when entrees came.Here are some of the good and bad:Good:- meatballs - tender, juicy, flavorful- wild mushroom ravioli - good, not spectacular- calamari - nicely battered and fried- squid ink linguine - good balance of flavors- lamb pappardelle - again, good, but not spectacular."
0,I dont typically ever go out for brunch but we were running out of double date ideas so we tried this little place in Astoria which was a halfway point for us
0,It was soooo good.
0,Would of liked to see a little more variation for brunch
0,We tried to order a dish without pork and they couldn't oblige seeing as how it had already been made and was just waiting to be served.
0,Good options for vegetarians here
0,"You may have to wait a while for your food though, so plan ahead and go before you're super starving."
0,"As for the food, everything was bursting with incredible combinations of flavours, and although portion sizes were small, (average for modern restaurants), I left enormously satisfied and will definitely come back."
0,"But, that's the great thing about Astoria, there are so many random little places that are just waiting to be found."
0,"The brunch was good-- The waffles were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and there was the right amount of bananas and walnuts to top it off."
0,Do they normally not put it on ice or was that because we looked brutish and like it didnt matter
0,We all loved the food and the drinks mango mimosa was amazing
0,The Locale had lots of variety and it took us a while to decide so Im definitely looking forward to coming back and trying something newThe atmosphere at Locale was probably the best thing about this place
0,"It was beautiful outside that day so I was bummed to be sitting inside, but the place was so wide open that I felt like we were sitting outside the whole time."
0,"The decor is also really cute - there are couches in the corner that I sat in a couple of months ago for another brunch.The service was great - the man who greeted us at the door (I assume he was the owner) was really sweet and our waitress was also great, very attentive."
0,Delicious mushroom benedict friendly staff and chill ambiance
0,Most of the reviews seem to be for brunch and maybe I'll try their brunch and see how that goes.
0,There menu recently changed but many new favorites.
0,A nice location great for the locals and any visitors from out of town
0,Theres not really unique or special or must order about their menu
0,If the entrees were priced in the 12-15 dollar range I would give them another star or two.
0,Deserts were a high point of the meal but still not amazing.
0,Far more disturbing was the lack of salt and general low tide fishy smell that came from the dish.
0,Not a single person in our group had anything positive to say about this place.
0,That's just pathetic.
0,"Not only was it already prepared and ready to just be dished out, but the food was just bad."
0,because its disgusting
0,Everyone in our party took maybe two bites and set it aside.The steak was just average and I finished it just for the sake of eating with everyone.
0,I think we can sit for another minute alright?
0,"They cheapened the whole experience while not skimping on the bill one bit.Pushy service, ridiculous prices, absent minded waitress, and just GOD-AWFUL food."
0,Maybe this is a place that should just close on new year's eve instead of acting like they are a 5 star restaurant and charging outrageous prices.Two stars is a generous rating especially with all of the other places in Astoria that have awesome deals and good food on New Year's Eve.
0,Low and behold I got a piece of fish that managed to be wildly underdone in some spots while wildly overdone in others
0,"I'm a big fan of their brunch!I will say one thing... the waitress did not know what ""grilled cheese"" was.... don't recommend bringing the kids... Nice neighborhood restaurant."
0,"Appetizers included calamari, braise meatballs, duck confit, and Entrées included organic chicken, lamb ragu Pappardella, short rib risotto, and skirt steak.The lamb ragu Paparedella was the least favorite dish."
0,The pasta seemed dry.The skirt steak was the best.
0,I found mine to be a mismatch of flavors which sounded good on paper but wasn't good in execution.
0,It was supposed to be a mix of mescal muddled cucumber ginger and jalapeño
0,All I could taste was the cucumber.
0,What I really like about Locale is their fairly extensive list of daily specials.
0,We had an amazing lemongarlic shrimp appetizer special one night that had us both raving
0,Brunch ehLet me start by saying there is a woman who lives nearby who drags her dog on a skateboard back and forth in front of the restaurant while youre eating
0,"I'll take care of it!"""
0,"My wife's gemelli aqua pazza with shrimp had way too few shrimp--I understand that shrimp is both singular and plural, but still--and had no fennel and little tomato broth, two key ingredients in an aqua pazza dish."
0,"The ragu bolognese was dry, and the polenta was incredibly underseasoned and lacking in richness."
0,Polenta even when made with water or broth should be generously finished with butter and cheese for flavor body and mouthfeel
0,"Still, I understand that I'm eating in Astoria, and I can't expect too much from the restaurants here."
0,"So I  would have given Gastroteca at least one more star, had it not been for the miserably poor service we experienced after our entree plates had been cleared."
0,"The rest of the floor staff in a by now empty restaurant were congregating by the bar, chatting with each other, ignoring us completely."
0,But the general ineptitude of the service and inability to make up for it on a slow night is absolutely inexcusable.
0,"He made a solid wine recommendation for pairing with the food I ordered, and was fairly  attentive, although he seemed inordinately harried for a less-than-crowded restaurant."
0,I went here for brunch and was really expecting great things bc the decor was so nice and the food looked so good.
0,"Explained it to our server and she was very sorry but still, there was hair in each of our meals."
0,"The zucchini fries appetizer was enjoyable, I enjoyed the unique presentation of the vegetable."
0,"The chicken was dry, not lemony, and had very little sauce to accompany it."
0,The highlight of the meal was the dessert - both the lemon pana cotta and chocolate mousse were flavorful and delicious.
0,I may come back to try the pastas off their regular menu and some more dessert but with all the great restaurants to visit in Astoria it won't be anytime soon.
0,"In addition to the standard marinara sauce and lemon wedge, the plate was topped with a fried long green pepper, whose spiciness paired well with the lightly battered squid."
0,"Our waiter, identified on the check as Robert, was fairly knowledgable about Italian food and wine."
0,"If that's not entertainment, I don't know what is.The service was okay, a little distant but efficient."
0,"The brunch menu is a great combo of breakfast and lunch fare, and I have always found the service to be quick and friendly but never rushed."
0,I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I feel like it was just kind of missing some energy.
0,It could have been hotter and the English muffin didn't have much crispiness to it.
0,"Believe me, you'll see the words Cheddar Polenta on the sides and you will think, ""omg, I must have that.""."
0,I wish it were and wish I  could praise its deliciousness but it really was just a bowl of orange colored cornmeal with some cheese melted on top.
0,"So disappointed.Maybe I should have ordered something different, but with so many other brunch options nearby, I don't think I'll give them a second chance."
0,And attitude from the server you show said discount to
0,At 1130am THAT MORNING I received a call that they needed to cancel my reservation
0,"!we ordered 2 cocktails and some crostini before the appetizers ,the cocktails were very small (12$each) and we did not finish yet the crostini that they bring the appetizers on the very small table makes you feel uncomfortable and a little bit in a hurry.the portion were smaller than expected at the end it s too much expansive for the service and the cuisine provided Again, a dinner that was shockingly good, and a great value!"
0,"I don't eat meat aside from fish, but my wife had the roasted chicken dish the last time we were there and was floored with the quality.The wait staff has always been very friendly and the bar is fully stocked and the bar tenders know what they're doing.I saw some negative posts about the owner, which I can't speak to, but I will say that every interaction I've had with him has been very positive."
0,Very comfyHad a few drinks my Dirty Kettle One Martini was made perfectlyThank you
0,The BF had the pappardelle & lamb ragu...which he wasn't crazy about.
0,"They should put the whipped goat cheese off to the side, where you have the option of mixing it in."
0,Just a suggestionOf course I had a sweet tooth at the end of my amazing and very filling linguini dish so we shared the Flourless Dark Chocolate Cake w Espresso Gelato on top
0,"Divine.Dinner here wasn't cheap, the prices are moderate..slightly  expensive...more expensive than most  places in the  neighborhood."
0,I could have walked half a block down the street to McDonalds and ordered something without pork and it would have been made fresh to order.
0,I have absolutely no cooking experience but I could have made food better than the food they served us.Everything was pre-made in bulk so that they wouldn't have to prepare anything later.
0,I'm originally from the Adirondacks so that's what I'm used to and you would be surprised how many places done use the real stuff!!
0,I couldn't believe what a rip-off this place was.I went here for New Year's with a bunch of friends and seeing as how it was a pretty expensive pre-fixe menu we figured we'd be getting some good food and service.
0,Gastroteca makes their pasta in house  it came out quite delicious and flavorful
0,The eggs were perfectly poached & the yolk was snapchat worthy: runny.
0,The decor was nice but the tables were sticky.
0,"The food is consistently good weekend after weekend, the staff relaxed and welcoming (although every once in a whiley group will get an inattentive waitress, but usually stay for 3+ hours so it makes no difference), and the carafes typically strong."
0,Try the zeppoles and if you order the eggplant sandwhich definitely order extra sauce
0,All the ingredients used were standard.
0,It really felt like something I could have made at home if I had the ingredients.
0,The place feels very spacious because of ceiling to floor windows.I'm sure the food is consistent but it's not a place that I will remember when looking for a brunch place given the many choices in the neighborhood.
0,Either way my companion had the brunch Caesar salad and that too was delicious
0,I finally go to go this morning and I'm so happy to finally cross this one off.

0,Save yourself the disappointment and dont bother eating anything
0,Was happy they have nice juice choices but for 300 they serve it in a rocks glass so basically you dont with it within 10 minutes
0,"I went for brunch very early Sunday right after I went to the gym, wasn't looking to drink really."
0,The only reason I am giving it four stars is because of the service.The service was not the greatest.Also they need more drink variations.More of the brunch drinks are bloody Mary's which I am not a fan of.
0,I always make a early reservation for brunch as they book up very quickly
0,"Even when there was a mix up with out reservation, she was still super nice and accommodating."

0,"It was a full house, but we had reservations so the wait was not bad at all."

0,I will def need to be on an empty stomach for that one.I was not completely sold on this place - mostly due to price and amount of food.
0,I ordered the carbonara pasta which would have been delicious but when I took my first bite it wasnt even hot
0,"As a dessert, I had the Zeppoli's and honestly they weren't all that.I was super excited because all of the reviews mention it but it honestly isn't worth it."
0,It was just kale with lardons and very little dressing.
0,"I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but it was less than average and Gastroteca has never been average.Our started, however, were absolutely delightful!"
0,Those a definite must try
0,My friend had the fried chicken with buttermilk waffles and the other had  a shrimp scampi with grits I tried them both and very good choice.. Everything was so good.. All 3 of us washed it down with a Spicy bloody Mary and mimosa..
0,I will return everything from staff to food and location was amazing.. Omg this is like a hidden gem.
0,This platter was super cheesy and delicious.
0,The bread at the table was nothing short of some cornbread wonder bread hybrid.
0,Far from Italian anything
0,"Our meals came, simple pasta dishes (ravioli and seafood pasta)  that should have been hard to mess up."
0,The tables are just so low it makes it difficult to eat (especially if you have a bun in the oven) and it is basically knee-height causing extra discomfort.Strike 2:  They really overpack the restaurant at peak times.
0,"That day was 85 degrees, and it was too hot eating w/o AC.I ordered Fried eggs with cheddar polenta & sausage patty."
0,has an airy feel
0,Dont get me wrong I still think they have some of the best food around but for the complete package they have fallen off quite a bit

0,I really dont like sitting in the lounge area even though I have many times
0,It was extremely hot and crowded.
0,Lots of windows if youre into peoplewatching
0,"Also, the restaurant is one big fire hazard when its packed."
0,"Tonight, our food was extremely slow."
0,"Also, it should come as no surprise to a restaurant that it is going to be bumping on a Friday night and the kitchen should either (1) be prepared for the crowd, (2) don't seat so many tables so you can handle the orders timely and efficiently, or (3) move to a larger location and hire the appropriate help."
0,I just dont like paying good money for a meal and not being able to swap out a simple thing such as the type of potato when the other type is also on the menu
0,"I must add that the maitre de was conscious of the slow delivery of food and did right by us, but I still feel I would be doing a disservice to yelp by not talking about my experience."
0,Get it together Locale
0,A bit pricey for Queens
0,Nice ambiance trendy but not hipster
0,Its like a nice place to get a drink

0,"Though the restaurant wasn't full, we still had to wait to be seated."
0,"I had to order my coffee twice before I got it, and when it arrived, the coffee cup had a bright pink lipstick stain on it."

0,Indeed the brunch entrées that dont include vegetables dont even come with a small salad on the side  not a very balanced meal
0,Upside Great food  beverage options
0,"yelp.com/biz_photos/SPYM It was pretty decent, but when I think polenta I think of Vesta's amazing polenta brunch entrée and suddenly Locale's just can't compare.If I thought that this was just an isolated or fluke experience, I would have given Locale 3 stars, but my friend said she experienced the same lack of service the last time she was at Locale."
0,"With so many great brunch options in Astoria, Locale's lackluster food and careless service just doesn't cut it."
0,"Pasta always al dente, pesto and tomato sauces are ALWAYS on point."
0,Also has an excellent atmosphere
0,"This place is good all around, I'm excited to try the the rest of they're menu!"

0,Dont miss the breakfast potatoes
