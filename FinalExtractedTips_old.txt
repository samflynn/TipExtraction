Will definitely be back
The ambiance is great.
Fantastic 
I would go again.
Highly recommend
The rice balls and baked clams were delicious ESPECIALLY THE RICE BALLS!!!
Love this place they have amazing Chicken Parm
Thank you
Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.
Very nice restaurant.
Service was wonderful as well.
Very gluten free friendly, with yummy gluten free pasta on the menu (helpful as someone with Celiac).
We were seated quickly and the back area was almost empty when we got there.
Spaghetti and meatballs were safe.
For my entree I ordered the Gamberi pasta dish, which contains broccoli, shrimp, and mozarella with a creamy pink sauce, but asked to substitute asparagus for broccoli since I'm not big on broccoli.
The menu sounded amazing and the atmosphere seemed cool
Sliders were average though.
Our server was enthusiastic and attentive.
Pastas look great and main courses too.
Then we had the pasta Norma (eggplant) which was just OK as I am not a huge eggplant fan.
Please
I would give it a 5 starts but I'd give it a 2 because of their horrible service.
Next time, I'll get something without the spice.
The pasta (rigatoni) was cooked al dente and to perfection, the sauce had this delicious salty yet savory taste to it.
I had a birthday dinner reservation here last night, and my two friends and I arrived early.
Tasty appetizers but entrees were mediocre.
The spicy calamari is basically soggy calamari smothered in spicy sauce.
The happy hour deals are only available at the bar.
All 3 were bland no flavor
Eat eat eat drink and be happy as a clam
Definitely a place i urgently and encourage to visit but just in case make a reservation it gets very crowded easily
Love the panna cotta -vanilla bean for dessert.The lights inside are  too dim!
